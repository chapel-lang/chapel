libunwind README for Chapel
===========================

Currently Chapel doesn't include libunwind as a third-party package. The library
must be manually downloaded and extracted into the libunwind-src directory. See
the "Install libunwind into Chapel" section into this README file for more
informations. 

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to libunwind should be
directed to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net.

Install libunwind into Chapel
=============================

1. Download libunwind 1.1 from
   http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/libunwind//libunwind-1.1.tar.gz
2. Extract the package into the directory 
   $CHPL_HOME/third-party/libunwind/libunwind-src/. Please note that this
   directory must contains the un-tarballed libunwind package contents.

Chapel should now be able to build libunwind from source.
