amudprun README for Chapel
==========================

This builds a host version of the amudprun launcher from GASNet, by
pointing into the GASNet directory.

There are three machine types to consider when compiling GASNet:

1.  The machine on which the code is being compiled (or cross
    compiled), sometimes called the build machine

2.  The machine on which the launcher will run, the host machine

3.  The machine(s) to which the launcher will launch jobs, the target

By default, GASNet compiles the amudprun launcher for machine type
(3), the same as the rest of its code.  However, it is more correct,
and supports more kinds of architectures, to compile it for machine
type (2).

The library, libamudp.a, still needs to be compiled for both machine
types (2) and (3).  GASNet is left alone to take care of type (3), and
this directory takes care of type (2) in the case where
CHPL_LAUNCHER=amudprun .
