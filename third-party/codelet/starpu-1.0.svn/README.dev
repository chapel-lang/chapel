Developer Warnings
------------------

They are enabled only if the STARPU_DEVEL environment variable is
defined to a non-empty value, when calling configure.



Naming Conventions
------------------

* Prefix names of public objects (types, functions, etc.) with "starpu"

* Prefix names of internal objects (types, functions, etc.) with "_starpu"

* Names for qualified types (struct, union, enum) do not end with _t, _s or similar.
  Use _t only for typedef types, such as opaque public types, e.g
       typedef struct _starpu_data_state* starpu_data_handle_t;
  or
       typedef uint64_t starpu_tag_t;

* When a variable can only take a finite set of values, use an enum
  type instead of defining macros for each of the values.



Coding Style
------------

* Curly braces always go on a new line



Error handling
--------------
* Use STARPU_ABORT() for catastrophic errors, from which StarPU will never
  recover.

	switch (node_kind)
	{
		case STARPU_CPU_RAM:
			do_stg();
			break;
		...
		default:
			/* We cannot be here */
			STARPU_ABORT();
	}

* Use STARPU_ASSERT() to run checks that are very likely to succeed, but still
  are useful for debugging purposes. It should be OK to disable them with
  --enable-fast.

	STARPU_ASSERT(j->terminated != 0)
