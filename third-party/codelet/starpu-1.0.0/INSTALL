* Installing StarPU on a Unix machine
* Installing StarPU on Windows



Installing StarPU on a Unix machine
------------------------------------
$ ./autogen.sh # If running the SVN version
$ ./configure --prefix=<prefix>
$ make
$ make install



Installing StarPU on Windows
----------------------------

If you are building from a tarball downloaded from the website, you can skip the
cygwin part.

1. Install cygwin

http://cygwin.com/install.html

Make sure the following packages are available:
- (Devel)/subversion
- (Devel)/libtool
- (Devel)/gcc
- (Devel)/make
- your favorite editor (vi, emacs, ...)
- (Devel)/gdb
- (Archive)/zip
- (Devel)/pkg-config

2. Install mingw

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/

3. Install hwloc (not mandatory)

http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc

4. Install Microsoft Visual C++ Studio Express

   http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads

   Add in your path the following directories.
   (adjusting where necessary for the Installation location according to VC
    version and on 64 and 32bit Windows versions)

   On cygwin, with Visual C++ 2010 e.g.;

   export PATH="/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/Common7/IDE":$PATH
   export PATH="/cygdrive/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/bin":$PATH

   On MingW, with Visual C++ 2010, e.g.;

   export PATH="/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/Common7/IDE":$PATH
   export PATH="/c/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0/VC/bin":$PATH

   Try to call <lib.exe> and <link.exe> without any option to make sure these
   dump their help output with a series of options, otherwise no .def or .lib
   file will be produced.

5. Install GPU Drivers (not mandatory)

  5.1 Install Cuda

      http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_downloads.html

      You need to install at least the CUDA toolkit.

      libtool is not able to find the libraries automatically, you
      need to make some copies:

      copy c:\cuda\lib\cuda.lib c:\cuda\lib\libcuda.lib
      copy c:\cuda\lib\cudart.lib c:\cuda\lib\libcudart.lib
      copy c:\cuda\lib\cublas.lib c:\cuda\lib\libcublas.lib
      copy c:\cuda\lib\cufft.lib c:\cuda\lib\libcufft.lib
      copy c:\cuda\lib\OpenCL.lib c:\cuda\lib\libOpenCL.lib

      (and if the version of your CUDA driver is >= 3.2)

      copy c:\cuda\lib\curand.lib c:\cuda\lib\libcurand.lib

      Add the CUDA bin directory in your path

      export PATH=/cygdrive/c/CUDA/bin:$PATH

      Since we tell nvcc to build CUDA code with gcc instead of Visual studio,
      a fix is needed: c:\cuda\include\host_defines.h has a bogus CUDARTAPI
      definition which makes linking fail completely. Replace the first
      occurence of

      #define CUDARTAPI

      with

      #ifdef _WIN32
      #define CUDARTAPI __stdcall
      #else
      #define CUDARTAPI
      #endif

      While at it, you can also comment the __cdecl definition to avoid spurious
      warnings.


  5.2 Install OpenCL

      http://developer.nvidia.com/object/opencl-download.html

      You need to download the NVIDIA Drivers for your version of
      Windows. Executing the file will extract all files in a given
      directory. The the driver installation will start, it will fail
      if no compatibles drivers can be found on your system.

      Anyway, you should copy the *.dl_ files from the directory
      (extraction path) in the bin directory of the CUDA installation
      directory (the directory should be v3.2/bin/)

  5.3 Install MsCompress

      http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/mscompress.htm

      Go in the CUDA bin directory, uncompress .dl_ files and rename
      them in .dll files

      cp /cygdrive/c/NVIDIA/DisplayDriver/190.89/International/*.dl_ .
      for i in *.dl_ ; do /cygdrive/c/Program\ Files/GnuWin32/bin/msexpand.exe  $i ; mv ${i%_} ${i%_}l ; done

If you are building from a tarball downloaded from the website, you can skip the
autogen.sh part.

6. Start autogen.sh from cygwin

   cd starpu-trunk
   ./autogen.sh

7. Start a MinGW shell

   /cygdrive/c/MinGW/msys/1.0/bin/sh.exe --login -i

8. Configure, make, install from MinGW

   If you have a non-english version of windows, use

     export LANG=C

   else libtool has troubles parsing the translated output of the toolchain.

   cd starpu-trunk
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ../configure --prefix=$PWD/target --disable-default-drand48 \
        --with-hwloc=<HWLOC installation directory> \
        --with-cuda-dir=<CUDA installation directory> \
        --with-cuda-lib-dir=<CUDA installation directory>/lib/Win32 \
	--with-opencl-dir=<CUDA installation directory>
   make
   make install

   Also convert a couple of files to CRLF:

   sed -e 's/$/'$'\015'/ < README > $PWD/target/README.txt
   sed -e 's/$/'$'\015'/ < AUTHORS > $PWD/target/AUTHORS.txt
   sed -e 's/$/'$'\015'/ < COPYING.LGPL > $PWD/target/COPYING.LGPL.txt

9. If you want your StarPU installation to be standalone, you need to
   copy the DLL files from hwloc, Cuda, and OpenCL into the StarPU
   installation bin directory, as well as MinGW/bin/libpthread*dll

   cp <CUDA directory>/bin/*dll target/bin
   cp <HWLOC directory>/bin/*dll target/bin
   cp /cygdrive/c/MinGW/bin/libpthread*dll target/bin

   and set the StarPU bin directory in your path.

   export PATH=<StarPU installation directory>/bin:$PATH
