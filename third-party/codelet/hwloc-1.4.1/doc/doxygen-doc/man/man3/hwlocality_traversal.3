.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Be sure to see the figure in \fBTerms and Definitions\fP that shows a complete topology tree, including depths, child/sibling/cousin relationships, and an example of an asymmetric topology where one socket has fewer caches than its peers\&.

.PP
Returns the topology object at logical index \fCidx\fP from depth \fCdepth\fP\&.

.PP
Returns the topology object at logical index \fCidx\fP with type \fCtype\fP\&. If no object for that type exists, \fCNULL\fP is returned\&. If there are several levels with objects of that type, \fCNULL\fP is returned and ther caller may fallback to \fBhwloc_get_obj_by_depth()\fP\&.
