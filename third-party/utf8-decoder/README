================================
UTF-8 decoder for Chapel release
================================

This copy of Bjoern Hoehrmann's UTF-8 decoder is being released with Chapel
for convenience and uses a copy of the code from:
http://bjoern.hoehrmann.de/utf-8/decoder/dfa/

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to this UTF-8 decoder should be
directed to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html, as the
cause is most likely due to Chapel's use of the UTF-8 decoder and not the
UTF-8 decoder code itself.

Changes from the version on the website:
 - the symbols are prefixed with 'qio' to avoid collisions
 - the decode routine is static
