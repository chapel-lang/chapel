======================
FLTK for Chapel release
======================

This copy of FLTK is being released with Cahpel for convenience and
uses a snapshot of FLTK obtained from the FLTK web site at
http://fltk.org.  We are using the 1.3.X branch.

FLTK is used for the chplvis program, a GUI tool to help visualize
your computation across locales.  For more information about FLTK,
please visit the above web site.

License Note: FLTK is under GPL-2 and LGPL-2.  There is one exception
to this, and that is static linking of the FLTK library with an
executible.  In that case, the executible is not considered a derative
work and thus does not fall under the LGPL-2 license.  This is the
case used by the Chapel use of FLTK.
