.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Distances between objects\&. 

One object may contain a distance structure describing distances between all its descendants at a given relative depth\&. If the containing object is the root object of the topology, then the distances are available for all objects in the machine\&.
.PP
If the \fClatency\fP pointer is not \fCNULL\fP, the pointed array contains memory latencies (non-zero values), as defined by the ACPI SLIT specification\&.
.PP
In the future, some other types of distances may be considered\&. In these cases, \fClatency\fP may be \fCNULL\fP\&. 
.SH "Field Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "float* \fBhwloc_distances_s::latency\fP"
.PP
Matrix of latencies between objects, stored as a one-dimension array\&. May be \fCNULL\fP if the distances considered here are not latencies\&. Values are normalized to get 1\&.0 as the minimal value in the matrix\&. Latency from i-th to j-th object is stored in slot i*nbobjs+j\&. 
.SS "float \fBhwloc_distances_s::latency_base\fP"
.PP
The multiplier that should be applied to latency matrix to retrieve the original OS-provided latencies\&. Usually 10 on Linux since ACPI SLIT uses 10 for local latency\&. 
.SS "float \fBhwloc_distances_s::latency_max\fP"
.PP
The maximal value in the latency matrix\&. 
.SS "unsigned \fBhwloc_distances_s::nbobjs\fP"
.PP
Number of objects considered in the matrix\&. It is the number of descendant objects at \fCrelative_depth\fP below the containing object\&. It corresponds to the result of hwloc_get_nbobjs_inside_cpuset_by_depth\&. 
.SS "unsigned \fBhwloc_distances_s::relative_depth\fP"
.PP
Relative depth of the considered objects below the object containing this distance information\&.
