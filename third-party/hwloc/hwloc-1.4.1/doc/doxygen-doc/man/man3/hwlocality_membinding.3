\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
Not all operating systems support all ways to bind existing allocated memory (e\&.g\&., migration), future memory allocation, explicit memory allocation, etc\&. Using a binding flag or policy that is not supported by the underlying OS will cause hwloc's binding functions to fail and return -1\&. errno will be set to ENOSYS when the system does support the specified action or policy (e\&.g\&., some systems only allow binding memory on a per-thread basis, whereas other systems only allow binding memory for all threads in a process)\&. errno will be set to EXDEV when the requested cpuset can not be enforced (e\&.g\&., some systems only allow binding memory to a single NUMA node)\&.
.RE
.PP
The most portable form that should be preferred over the others whenever possible is as follows:
.PP
.PP
.nf
 hwloc_alloc_membind_policy(topology, size, set, 
                            HWLOC_MEMBIND_DEFAULT, 0);
.fi
.PP
.PP
This will allocate some memory hopefully bound to the specified set\&. To do so, hwloc will possibly have to change the current memory binding policy in order to actually get the memory bound, if the OS does not provide any other way to simply allocate bound memory without changing the policy for all allocations\&. That is the difference with \fBhwloc_alloc_membind()\fP, which will never change the current memory binding policy\&. Note that since HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT was not specified, failures to bind will not be reported -- generally, only memory allocation failures will be reported (e\&.g\&., even a plain malloc() would have failed with ENOMEM)\&.
.PP
Each hwloc memory binding function is available in two forms: one that takes a CPU set argument and another that takes a NUMA memory node set argument (see \fBObject sets (hwloc_cpuset_t and hwloc_nodeset_t)\fP and \fBThe bitmap API\fP for a discussion of CPU sets and NUMA memory node sets)\&. The names of the latter form end with _nodeset\&. It is also possible to convert between CPU set and node set using \fBhwloc_cpuset_to_nodeset()\fP or \fBhwloc_cpuset_from_nodeset()\fP\&.
.PP

On some operating systems, memory binding affects the CPU binding; see \fBHWLOC_MEMBIND_NOCPUBIND\fP

Memory binding flags\&. These flags can be used to refine the binding policy\&. All flags can be logically OR'ed together with the exception of HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS and HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD; these two flags are mutually exclusive\&.

\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS \fP\fP
Set policy for all threads of the specified (possibly multithreaded) process\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with HWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_THREAD \fP\fP
Set policy for a specific thread of the current process\&. This flag is mutually exclusive with HWLOC_MEMBIND_PROCESS\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT \fP\fP
Request strict binding from the OS\&. The function will fail if the binding can not be guaranteed / completely enforced\&.
.PP
This flag has slightly different meanings depending on which function it is used with\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_MIGRATE \fP\fP
Migrate existing allocated memory\&. If the memory cannot be migrated and the HWLOC_MEMBIND_STRICT flag is passed, an error will be returned\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_NOCPUBIND \fP\fP
Avoid any effect on CPU binding\&. On some operating systems, some underlying memory binding functions also bind the application to the corresponding CPU(s)\&. Using this flag will cause hwloc to avoid using OS functions that could potentially affect CPU bindings\&. Note, however, that using NOCPUBIND may reduce hwloc's overall memory binding support\&. Specifically: some of hwloc's memory binding functions may fail with errno set to ENOSYS when used with NOCPUBIND\&.

\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_DEFAULT \fP\fP
Reset the memory allocation policy to the system default\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_FIRSTTOUCH \fP\fP
Allocate memory but do not immediately bind it to a specific locality\&. Instead, each page in the allocation is bound only when it is first touched\&. Pages are individually bound to the local NUMA node of the first thread that touches it\&. If there is not enough memory on the node, allocation may be done in the specified cpuset before allocating on other nodes\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_BIND \fP\fP
Allocate memory on the specified nodes\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_INTERLEAVE \fP\fP
Allocate memory on the given nodes in an interleaved / round-robin manner\&. The precise layout of the memory across multiple NUMA nodes is OS/system specific\&. Interleaving can be useful when threads distributed across the specified NUMA nodes will all be accessing the whole memory range concurrently, since the interleave will then balance the memory references\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_REPLICATE \fP\fP
Replicate memory on the given nodes; reads from this memory will attempt to be serviced from the NUMA node local to the reading thread\&. Replicating can be useful when multiple threads from the specified NUMA nodes will be sharing the same read-only data\&. This policy can only be used with existing memory allocations (i\&.e\&., the hwloc_set_*membind*() functions); it cannot be used with functions that allocate new memory (i\&.e\&., the hwloc_alloc*() functions)\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_NEXTTOUCH \fP\fP
For each page bound with this policy, by next time it is touched (and next time only), it is moved from its current location to the local NUMA node of the thread where the memory reference occurred (if it needs to be moved at all)\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMBIND_MIXED \fP\fP
Returned by hwloc_get_membind*() functions when multiple threads or parts of a memory area have differing memory binding policies\&.
