This Visual Studio support is experimental.
Thanks to Eloi Gaudry for contributing most of these files.

This may be directly open in VS, or built from the command-line with:
  %MSBUILD_PATH%\MSBuild hwloc.sln /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64

If the specified platform toolset is too recent for your VS installation:
  "The builds tools for v142 (Platform Toolset = 'v142') cannot be found."
You may force the build using your old one by adding
    /p:PlatformToolset=v110

See contrib/ci.inria.fr/job-1-visualstudio.bat for an example.


hwloc-compress-dir not built because it needs work.

hwloc-gather-topology is Linux specific.

hwloc-ps is not built because it does nothing on Windows anyway (see #367).
