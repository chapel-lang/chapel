/** \defgroup hwlocality_cpukinds Kinds of CPU cores
 *
 * Platforms with heterogeneous CPUs may have some cores with
 * different features or frequencies.
 * This API exposes identical PUs in sets called CPU kinds.
 * Each PU of the topology may only be in a single kind.
 *
 * The number of kinds may be obtained with hwloc_cpukinds_get_nr().
 * If the platform is homogeneous, there may be a single kind
 * with all PUs.
 * If the platform or operating system does not expose any
 * information about CPU cores, there may be no kind at all.
 *
 * The index of the kind that describes a given CPU set
 * (if any, and not partially)
 * may be obtained with hwloc_cpukinds_get_by_cpuset().
 *
 * From the index of a kind, it is possible to retrieve information
 * with hwloc_cpukinds_get_info():
 * an abstracted efficiency value,
 * and an array of info attributes
 * (for instance the "CoreType" and "FrequencyMaxMHz",
 *  see \ref topoattrs_cpukinds).
 *
 * A higher efficiency value means greater intrinsic performance
 * (and possibly less performance/power efficiency).
 * Kinds with lower efficiency values are ranked first:
 * Passing 0 as \p kind_index to hwloc_cpukinds_get_info() will
 * return information about the CPU kind with lower performance
 * but higher energy-efficiency.
 * Higher \p kind_index values would rather return information
 * about power-hungry high-performance cores.
 *
 * When available, efficiency values are gathered from the operating system.
 * If so, \p cpukind_efficiency is set in the struct hwloc_topology_discovery_support array.
 * This is currently available on Windows 10, Mac OS X (Darwin),
 * and on some Linux platforms where core "capacity" is exposed in sysfs.
 *
 * If the operating system does not expose core efficiencies natively,
 * hwloc tries to compute efficiencies by comparing CPU kinds using
 * frequencies (on ARM), or core types and frequencies (on other architectures).
 * The environment variable HWLOC_CPUKINDS_RANKING may be used
 * to change this heuristics, see \ref envvar.
 *
 * If hwloc fails to rank any kind, for instance because the operating
 * system does not expose efficiencies and core frequencies,
 * all kinds will have an unknown efficiency (\c -1),
 * and they are not indexed/ordered in any specific way.

 *
 * \p forced_efficiency should be \c -1 if unknown.
 * Otherwise it is an abstracted efficiency value to enforce
 * the ranking of all kinds if all of them have valid (and
 * different) efficiencies.
 *
 * The array \p infos of size \p nr_infos may be used to provide
 * info names and values describing this kind of PUs.

 * \p flags must be \c 0 for now.
 *
 * Parameters \p cpuset and \p infos will be duplicated internally,
 * the caller is responsible for freeing them.
 *
 * If \p cpuset overlaps with some existing kinds, those might get
 * modified or split. For instance if existing kind A contains
 * PUs 0 and 1, and one registers another kind for PU 1 and 2,
 * there will be 3 resulting kinds:
 * existing kind A is restricted to only PU 0;
 * new kind B contains only PU 1 and combines information from A
 * and from the newly-registered kind;
 * new kind C contains only PU 2 and only gets information from
 * the newly-registered kind.
 *
 * \note The efficiency \p forced_efficiency provided to this function
 * may be different from the one reported later by hwloc_cpukinds_get_info()
 * because hwloc will scale efficiency values down to
 * between 0 and the number of kinds minus 1.
