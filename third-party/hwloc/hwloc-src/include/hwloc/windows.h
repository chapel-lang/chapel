 * These functions query Windows processor groups.
 * These groups partition the operating system into virtual sets
 * of up to 64 neighbor PUs.
 * Threads and processes may only be bound inside a single group.
 * Although Windows processor groups may be exposed in the hwloc
 * hierarchy as hwloc Groups, they are also often merged into
 * existing hwloc objects such as NUMA nodes or Packages.
 * This API provides explicit information about Windows processor
 * groups so that applications know whether binding to a large
 * set of PUs may fail because it spans over multiple Windows
 * processor groups.
