.SH NAME
hwlocality_api_error_reporting \- Error reporting in the API
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.PP
.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Most functions in the hwloc API return an integer value\&. Unless documentated differently, they return 0 on success and -1 on error\&. Functions that return a pointer type return \fCNULL\fP on error\&.
.PP
\fCerrno\fP will be set to a meaningful value whenever possible\&. This includes the usual \fCEINVAL\fP when invalid function parameters are passed or \fCENOMEM\fP when an internal allocation fails\&. Some specific \fCerrno\fP value are also used, for instance for binding errors as documented in \fBCPU binding\fP\&.
.PP
Some modules describe return values of their functions in their introduction, for instance in \fBThe bitmap API\fP\&.
