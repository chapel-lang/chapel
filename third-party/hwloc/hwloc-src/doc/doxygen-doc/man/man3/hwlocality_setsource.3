.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
If none of the functions below is called, the default is to detect all the objects of the machine that the caller is allowed to access\&.
.PP
This default behavior may also be modified through environment variables if the application did not modify it already\&. Setting HWLOC_XMLFILE in the environment enforces the discovery from a XML file as if \fBhwloc_topology_set_xml()\fP had been called\&. Setting HWLOC_SYNTHETIC enforces a synthetic topology as if \fBhwloc_topology_set_synthetic()\fP had been called\&.
.PP
Finally, HWLOC_THISSYSTEM enforces the return value of \fBhwloc_topology_is_thissystem()\fP\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_set_components (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, unsigned long flags, const char *restrict name)"

.PP
Prevent a discovery component from being used for a topology\&. \fCname\fP is the name of the discovery component that should not be used when loading topology \fCtopology\fP\&. The name is a string such as 'cuda'\&.
.PP
For components with multiple phases, it may also be suffixed with the name of a phase, for instance 'linux:io'\&.
.PP
\fCflags\fP should be \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_COMPONENTS_FLAG_BLACKLIST\fP\&.
.PP
This may be used to avoid expensive parts of the discovery process\&. For instance, CUDA-specific discovery may be expensive and unneeded while generic I/O discovery could still be useful\&. 
.SS "int hwloc_topology_set_pid (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, hwloc_pid_t pid)"

.PP
Change which process the topology is viewed from\&. On some systems, processes may have different views of the machine, for instance the set of allowed CPUs\&. By default, hwloc exposes the view from the current process\&. Calling \fBhwloc_topology_set_pid()\fP permits to make it expose the topology of the machine from the point of view of another process\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
\fChwloc_pid_t\fP is \fCpid_t\fP on Unix platforms, and \fCHANDLE\fP on native Windows platforms\&.
.PP
-1 is returned and errno is set to ENOSYS on platforms that do not support this feature\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_topology_set_synthetic (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, const char *restrict description)"

.PP
Enable synthetic topology\&. Gather topology information from the given \fCdescription\fP, a space-separated string of <type:number> describing the object type and arity at each level\&. All types may be omitted (space-separated string of numbers) so that hwloc chooses all types according to usual topologies\&. See also the \fBSynthetic topologies\fP\&.
.PP
Setting the environment variable HWLOC_SYNTHETIC may also result in this behavior\&.
.PP
If \fCdescription\fP was properly parsed and describes a valid topology configuration, this function returns 0\&. Otherwise -1 is returned and errno is set to EINVAL\&.
.PP
Note that this function does not actually load topology information; it just tells hwloc where to load it from\&. You'll still need to invoke \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP to actually load the topology information\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just return success\&.
.PP
On success, the synthetic component replaces the previously enabled component (if any), but the topology is not actually modified until \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP\&.

.PP

.SS "int hwloc_topology_set_xml (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, const char *restrict xmlpath)"

.PP
Enable XML-file based topology\&. Gather topology information from the XML file given at \fCxmlpath\fP\&. Setting the environment variable HWLOC_XMLFILE may also result in this behavior\&. This file may have been generated earlier with \fBhwloc_topology_export_xml()\fP in \fBhwloc/export\&.h\fP, or lstopo file\&.xml\&.
.PP
Note that this function does not actually load topology information; it just tells hwloc where to load it from\&. You'll still need to invoke \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP to actually load the topology information\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
-1 with errno set to EINVAL on failure to read the XML file\&.

.RS 4
See also \fBhwloc_topology_set_userdata_import_callback()\fP for importing application-specific object userdata\&.
.PP
For convenience, this backend provides empty binding hooks which just return success\&. To have hwloc still actually call OS-specific hooks, the \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_IS_THISSYSTEM\fP has to be set to assert that the loaded file is really the underlying system\&.
.PP
On success, the XML component replaces the previously enabled component (if any), but the topology is not actually modified until \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_set_xmlbuffer (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, const char *restrict buffer, int size)"

.PP
Enable XML based topology using a memory buffer (instead of a file, as with \fBhwloc_topology_set_xml()\fP)\&. Gather topology information from the XML memory buffer given at \fCbuffer\fP and of length \fCsize\fP\&. This buffer may have been filled earlier with \fBhwloc_topology_export_xmlbuffer()\fP in \fBhwloc/export\&.h\fP\&.
.PP
Note that this function does not actually load topology information; it just tells hwloc where to load it from\&. You'll still need to invoke \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP to actually load the topology information\&.
