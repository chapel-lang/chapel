Distribute \fCn\fP items over the topology under \fCroots\fP\&. Array \fCset\fP will be filled with \fCn\fP cpusets recursively distributed linearly over the topology under objects \fCroots\fP, down to depth \fCuntil\fP (which can be INT_MAX to distribute down to the finest level)\&.
.PP
\fCn_roots\fP is usually 1 and \fCroots\fP only contains the topology root object so as to distribute over the entire topology\&.
.PP
This is typically useful when an application wants to distribute \fCn\fP threads over a machine, giving each of them as much private cache as possible and keeping them locally in number order\&.
.PP
The caller may typically want to also call \fBhwloc_bitmap_singlify()\fP before binding a thread so that it does not move at all\&.
.PP
\fCflags\fP should be 0 or a OR'ed set of \fBhwloc_distrib_flags_e\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, -1 on error\&.

.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
On hybrid CPUs (or asymmetric platforms), distribution may be suboptimal since the number of cores or PUs inside packages or below caches may vary (the top-down recursive partitioning ignores these numbers until reaching their levels)\&. Hence it is recommended to distribute only inside a single homogeneous domain\&. For instance on a CPU with energy-efficient E-cores and high-performance P-cores, one should distribute separately N tasks on E-cores and M tasks on P-cores instead of trying to distribute directly M+N tasks on the entire CPUs\&.
.PP
This function requires the \fCroots\fP objects to have a CPU set\&.
