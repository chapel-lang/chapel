.PP
Setup object cpusets/nodesets by OR'ing another object's sets\&. For each defined cpuset or nodeset in \fCsrc\fP, allocate the corresponding set in \fCdst\fP and add \fCsrc\fP to it by OR'ing sets\&.
.PP
This function is convenient between \fBhwloc_topology_alloc_group_object()\fP and \fBhwloc_topology_insert_group_object()\fP\&. It builds the sets of the new Group that will be inserted as a new intermediate parent of several objects\&.

.PP
Allocate a Group object to insert later with \fBhwloc_topology_insert_group_object()\fP\&. This function returns a new Group object\&.
.PP
The caller should (at least) initialize its sets before inserting the object in the topology, see \fBhwloc_topology_insert_group_object()\fP\&. Or it may decide not to insert and just free the group object by calling \fBhwloc_topology_free_group_object()\fP\&.

\fCNULL\fP on error\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
If successfully inserted by \fBhwloc_topology_insert_group_object()\fP, the object will be freed when the entire topology is freed\&. If insertion failed (e\&.g\&. \fCNULL\fP or empty CPU and node-sets), it is freed before returning the error\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_allow (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fP cpuset, \fBhwloc_const_nodeset_t\fP nodeset, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Change the sets of allowed PUs and NUMA nodes in the topology\&. This function only works if the \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED\fP was set on the topology\&. It does not modify any object, it only changes the sets returned by \fBhwloc_topology_get_allowed_cpuset()\fP and \fBhwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset()\fP\&.
.PP
It is notably useful when importing a topology from another process running in a different Linux Cgroup\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_free_group_object (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP group)"

.PP
Free a group object allocated with \fBhwloc_topology_alloc_group_object()\fP\&. This function is only useful if the group object was not given to \fBhwloc_topology_insert_group_object()\fP as planned\&.
.PP

.PP

.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_topology_insert_group_object (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP group)"

.PP
Add more structure to the topology by adding an intermediate Group\&. The caller should first allocate a new Group object with \fBhwloc_topology_alloc_group_object()\fP\&. Then it must setup at least one of its CPU or node sets to specify the final location of the Group in the topology\&. Then the object can be passed to this function for actual insertion in the topology\&.
.PP
The main use case for this function is to group a subset of siblings among the list of children below a single parent\&. For instance, if grouping 4 cores out of a 8-core socket, the logical list of cores will be reordered so that the 4 grouped ones are consecutive\&. Then, if needed, a new depth is added between the parent and those children, and the Group is inserted there\&. At the end, the 4 grouped cores are now children of the Group, which replaces them as a child of the original parent\&.
.PP
In practice, the grouped objects are specified through cpusets and/or nodesets, for instance using \fBhwloc_obj_add_other_obj_sets()\fP iteratively\&. Hence it is possible to group objects that are not children of the same parent, for instance some PUs below the 4 cores in example above\&. However this general case may fail if the expected Group conflicts with the existing hierarchy\&. For instance if each core has two PUs, it is not possible to insert a Group containing a single PU of each core\&.
.PP
To specify the objects to group, either the cpuset or nodeset field (or both, if compatible) must be set to a non-empty bitmap\&. The complete_cpuset or complete_nodeset may be set instead if inserting with respect to the complete topology (including disallowed, offline or unknown objects)\&. These sets cannot be larger than the current topology, or they would get restricted silently\&. The core will setup the other sets after actual insertion\&.
.PP
The \fCsubtype\fP object attribute may be defined with \fBhwloc_obj_set_subtype()\fP to display something else than 'Group' as the type name for this object in lstopo\&. Custom name-value info pairs may be added with \fBhwloc_obj_add_info()\fP after insertion\&.
.PP
The group \fCdont_merge\fP attribute may be set to \fC1\fP to prevent the hwloc core from ever merging this object with another hierarchically-identical object\&. This is useful when the Group itself describes an important feature that cannot be exposed anywhere else in the hierarchy\&.
.PP
The group \fCkind\fP attribute may be set to a high value such as \fC0xffffffff\fP to tell hwloc that this new Group should always be discarded in favor of any existing Group with the same locality\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Inserting a group adds some locality information to the topology, hence the existing objects may get reordered (including PUs and NUMA nodes), and their logical indexes may change\&.
.PP
If the insertion fails, the input group object is freed\&.
.PP
If the group object should be discarded instead of inserted, it may be passed to \fBhwloc_topology_free_group_object()\fP instead\&.
.PP
\fCtopology\fP must be the same as the one previously passed to \fBhwloc_topology_alloc_group_object()\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The inserted object if it was properly inserted\&.
.PP
An existing object if the Group was merged or discarded because the topology already contained an object at the same location (the Group did not add any hierarchy information)\&.
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if the insertion failed because of conflicting sets in topology tree\&.
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if Group objects are filtered-out of the topology (\fBHWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE\fP)\&.
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if the object was discarded because no set was initialized in the Group before insert, or all of them were empty\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP parent, const char * name)"

.PP
Add a MISC object as a leaf of the topology\&. A new MISC object will be created and inserted into the topology at the position given by parent\&. It is appended to the list of existing Misc children, without ever adding any intermediate hierarchy level\&. This is useful for annotating the topology without actually changing the hierarchy\&.
.PP
\fCname\fP is supposed to be unique across all Misc objects in the topology\&. It will be duplicated to setup the new object attributes\&.
.PP
The new leaf object will not have any \fCcpuset\fP\&.
.PP
The \fCsubtype\fP object attribute may be defined with \fBhwloc_obj_set_subtype()\fP after successful insertion\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
the newly-created object
.PP
\fCNULL\fP on error\&.
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if Misc objects are filtered-out of the topology (\fBHWLOC_TYPE_FILTER_KEEP_NONE\fP)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
If \fCname\fP contains some non-printable characters, they will be dropped when exporting to XML, see \fBhwloc_topology_export_xml()\fP in \fBhwloc/export\&.h\fP\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_refresh (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology)"

.PP
Refresh internal structures after topology modification\&. Modifying the topology (by restricting, adding objects, modifying structures such as distances or memory attributes, etc\&.) may cause some internal caches to become invalid\&. These caches are automatically refreshed when accessed but this refreshing is not thread-safe\&.
.PP
This function is not thread-safe either, but it is a good way to end a non-thread-safe phase of topology modification\&. Once this refresh is done, multiple threads may concurrently consult the topology, objects, distances, attributes, etc\&.
.PP

-1 on error, for instance if some internal reallocation failed\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_restrict (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restrict topology, \fBhwloc_const_bitmap_t\fP set, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Restrict the topology to the given CPU set or nodeset\&. Topology \fCtopology\fP is modified so as to remove all objects that are not included (or partially included) in the CPU set \fCset\fP\&. All objects CPU and node sets are restricted accordingly\&.
.PP
By default, \fCset\fP is a CPU set\&. It means that the set of PUs in the topology is restricted\&. Once some PUs got removed, their parents may also get removed recursively if they became child-less\&.
.PP
If \fBHWLOC_RESTRICT_FLAG_BYNODESET\fP is passed in \fCflags\fP, \fCset\fP is considered a nodeset instead of a CPU set\&. It means that the set of NUMA nodes in the topology is restricted (instead of PUs)\&. Once some NUMA nodes got removed, their parents may also get removed recursively if they became child-less\&.
.PP
\fCflags\fP is a OR'ed set of \fBhwloc_restrict_flags_e\fP\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Restricting the topology removes some locality information, hence the remaining objects may get reordered (including PUs and NUMA nodes), and their logical indexes may change\&.
.PP
This call may not be reverted by restricting back to a larger set\&. Once dropped during restriction, objects may not be brought back, except by loading another topology with \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
0 on success\&.
.PP
-1 with errno set to \fCEINVAL\fP if the input set is invalid\&. The topology is not modified in this case\&.
.PP
-1 with errno set to \fCENOMEM\fP on failure to allocate internal data\&. The topology is reinitialized in this case\&. It should be either destroyed with \fBhwloc_topology_destroy()\fP or configured and loaded again\&.
