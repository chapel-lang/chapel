.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about OpenCL devices\&.
.PP
Only AMD and NVIDIA OpenCL implementations currently offer useful locality information about their devices\&. 
.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "int hwloc_opencl_get_device_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, cl_device_id device, \fBhwloc_cpuset_t\fP set)\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
Get the CPU set of processors that are physically close to OpenCL device \fCdevice\fP\&. Store in \fCset\fP the CPU-set describing the locality of the OpenCL device \fCdevice\fP\&.
.PP
Topology \fCtopology\fP and device \fCdevice\fP must match the local machine\&. I/O devices detection and the OpenCL component are not needed in the topology\&.
.PP
The function only returns the locality of the device\&. If more information about the device is needed, OS objects should be used instead, see \fBhwloc_opencl_get_device_osdev()\fP and \fBhwloc_opencl_get_device_osdev_by_index()\fP\&.
.PP
This function is currently only implemented in a meaningful way for Linux with the AMD or NVIDIA OpenCL implementation; other systems will simply get a full cpuset\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
0 on success\&. 
.PP
-1 on error, for instance if the device could not be found\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_opencl_get_device_osdev (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, cl_device_id device)\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to OpenCL device \fCdeviceX\fP\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The hwloc OS device object corresponding to the given OpenCL device \fCdevice\fP\&. 
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if none could be found, for instance if required OpenCL attributes are not available\&.
.RE
.PP
This function currently only works on AMD and NVIDIA OpenCL devices that support relevant OpenCL extensions\&. \fBhwloc_opencl_get_device_osdev_by_index()\fP should be preferred whenever possible, i\&.e\&. when platform and device index are known\&.
.PP
Topology \fCtopology\fP and device \fCdevice\fP must match the local machine\&. I/O devices detection and the OpenCL component must be enabled in the topology\&. If not, the locality of the object may still be found using \fBhwloc_opencl_get_device_cpuset()\fP\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
This function cannot work if PCI devices are filtered out\&.
.PP
The corresponding hwloc PCI device may be found by looking at the result parent pointer (unless PCI devices are filtered out)\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_opencl_get_device_osdev_by_index (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, unsigned platform_index, unsigned device_index)\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the OpenCL device for the given indexes\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The hwloc OS device object describing the OpenCL device whose platform index is \fCplatform_index\fP, and whose device index within this platform if \fCdevice_index\fP\&. 
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if there is none\&.
.RE
.PP
The topology \fCtopology\fP does not necessarily have to match the current machine\&. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host\&. I/O devices detection and the OpenCL component must be enabled in the topology\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out)\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_opencl_get_device_pci_busid (cl_device_id device, unsigned * domain, unsigned * bus, unsigned * dev, unsigned * func)\fC [inline]\fP"

.PP
Return the domain, bus and device IDs of the OpenCL device \fCdevice\fP\&. Device \fCdevice\fP must match the local machine\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
0 on success\&. 
.PP
-1 on error, for instance if device information could not be found\&.
