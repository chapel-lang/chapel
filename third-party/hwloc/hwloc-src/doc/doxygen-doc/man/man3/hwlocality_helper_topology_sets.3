.PP
Get allowed CPU set\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
the CPU set of allowed processors of the system\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
If the topology flag \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED\fP was not set, this is identical to \fBhwloc_topology_get_topology_cpuset()\fP, which means all PUs are allowed\&.
.PP
If \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED\fP was set, applying \fBhwloc_bitmap_intersects()\fP on the result of this function and on an object cpuset checks whether there are allowed PUs inside that object\&. Applying \fBhwloc_bitmap_and()\fP returns the list of these allowed PUs\&.
.PP
The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed, \fBhwloc_bitmap_dup()\fP must be used to obtain a local copy\&.

.SS "\fBhwloc_const_nodeset_t\fP hwloc_topology_get_allowed_nodeset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology)"

.PP
Get allowed node set\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
the node set of allowed memory of the system\&.
.RE

\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
If the topology flag \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED\fP was not set, this is identical to \fBhwloc_topology_get_topology_nodeset()\fP, which means all NUMA nodes are allowed\&.
.PP
If \fBHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_FLAG_INCLUDE_DISALLOWED\fP was set, applying \fBhwloc_bitmap_intersects()\fP on the result of this function and on an object nodeset checks whether there are allowed NUMA nodes inside that object\&. Applying \fBhwloc_bitmap_and()\fP returns the list of these allowed NUMA nodes\&.
.PP
The returned nodeset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed, \fBhwloc_bitmap_dup()\fP must be used to obtain a local copy\&.

The returned cpuset is not newly allocated and should thus not be changed or freed; \fBhwloc_bitmap_dup()\fP must be used to obtain a local copy\&.

This is equivalent to retrieving the root object complete CPU-set\&.
