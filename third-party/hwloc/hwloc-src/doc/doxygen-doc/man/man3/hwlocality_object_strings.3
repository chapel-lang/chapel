.SS "int hwloc_obj_attr_snprintf (char *restrict string, size_t size, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP obj, const char *restrict separator, int verbose)"

.PP
Stringify the attributes of a given topology object into a human-readable form\&. Attribute values are separated by \fCseparator\fP\&.
.PP
Only the major attributes are printed in non-verbose mode\&.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0)\&. 
.RE

.SS "int hwloc_obj_cpuset_snprintf (char *restrict str, size_t size, size_t nobj, const \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP *restrict objs)"

.PP
Stringify the cpuset containing a set of objects\&. If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0)\&. 
.RE

.SS "int hwloc_obj_type_snprintf (char *restrict string, size_t size, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP obj, int verbose)"

.PP
Stringify the type of a given topology object into a human-readable form\&. Contrary to \fBhwloc_obj_type_string()\fP, this function includes object-specific attributes (such as the Group depth, the Bridge type, or OS device type) in the output, and it requires the caller to provide the output buffer\&.
.PP
The output is guaranteed to be the same for all objects of a same topology level\&.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0)\&.

.SS "int hwloc_obj_type_sscanf (const char * string, \fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fP * typep, int * depthattrp, void * typeattrp, size_t typeattrsize)"

.PP
Return an object type and attributes from a type string\&. Convert strings such as 'Package' or 'Cache' into the corresponding types\&. Matching is case-insensitive, and only the first letters are actually required to match\&.
.PP
This function is guaranteed to match any string returned by \fBhwloc_obj_type_string()\fP or \fBhwloc_obj_type_snprintf()\fP\&.
.PP
Types that have specific attributes, for instance caches and groups, may be returned in \fCdepthattrp\fP and \fCtypeattrp\fP\&. They are ignored when these pointers are \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
For instance 'L2i' or 'L2iCache' would return type HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE in \fCtypep\fP, 2 in \fCdepthattrp\fP, and HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE_TYPE_INSTRUCTION in \fCtypeattrp\fP (this last pointer should point to a hwloc_obj_cache_type_t)\&. 'Group3' would return type HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP type and 3 in \fCdepthattrp\fP\&. Attributes that are not specified in the string (for instance 'Group' without a depth, or 'L2Cache' without a cache type) are set to -1\&.
.PP
\fCtypeattrp\fP is only filled if the size specified in \fCtypeattrsize\fP is large enough\&. It is currently only used for caches, and the required size is at least the size of hwloc_obj_cache_type_t\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 if a type was correctly identified, otherwise -1\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This is an extended version of the now deprecated hwloc_obj_type_of_string() 
.RE
.PP

.SS "const char* hwloc_obj_type_string (\fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fP type)"

.PP
Return a constant stringified object type\&. This function is the basic way to convert a generic type into a string\&.
.PP
\fBhwloc_obj_type_snprintf()\fP may return a more precise output for a specific object, but it requires the caller to provide the output buffer\&.
