.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Matrix of distances between a set of objects\&. 

The most common matrix contains latencies between NUMA nodes (as reported in the System Locality Distance Information Table (SLIT) in the ACPI specification), which may or may not be physically accurate\&. It corresponds to the latency for accessing the memory of one node from a core in another node\&. The corresponding kind is \fBHWLOC_DISTANCES_KIND_MEANS_LATENCY\fP | \fBHWLOC_DISTANCES_KIND_FROM_USER\fP\&. The name of this distances structure is 'NUMALatency'\&.
.PP
The matrix may also contain bandwidths between random sets of objects, possibly provided by the user, as specified in the \fCkind\fP attribute\&. Others common distance structures include and 'XGMIBandwidth', 'XGMIHops', 'XeLinkBandwidth' and 'NVLinkBandwidth'\&.
.PP
Pointers \fCobjs\fP and \fCvalues\fP should not be replaced, reallocated, freed, etc\&. However callers are allowed to modify \fCkind\fP as well as the contents of \fCobjs\fP and \fCvalues\fP arrays\&. For instance, if there is a single NUMA node per Package, \fBhwloc_get_obj_with_same_locality()\fP may be used to convert between them and replace NUMA nodes in the \fCobjs\fP array with the corresponding Packages\&. See also \fBhwloc_distances_transform()\fP for applying some transformations to the structure\&.

.SS "unsigned long hwloc_distances_s::kind"

.PP
OR'ed set of \fBhwloc_distances_kind_e\fP\&. 
.SS "unsigned hwloc_distances_s::nbobjs"

.PP
Number of objects described by the distance matrix\&. 
.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP* hwloc_distances_s::objs"

.PP
Array of objects described by the distance matrix\&. These objects are not in any particular order, see \fBhwloc_distances_obj_index()\fP and \fBhwloc_distances_obj_pair_values()\fP for easy ways to find objects in this array and their corresponding values\&. 
.SS "hwloc_uint64_t* hwloc_distances_s::values"

.PP
Matrix of distances between objects, stored as a one-dimension array\&. Distance from i-th to j-th object is stored in slot i*nbobjs+j\&. The meaning of the value depends on the \fCkind\fP attribute\&.
