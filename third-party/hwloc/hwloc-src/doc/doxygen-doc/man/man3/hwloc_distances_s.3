.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Matrix of distances between a set of objects\&. 

This matrix often contains latencies between NUMA nodes (as reported in the System Locality Distance Information Table (SLIT) in the ACPI specification), which may or may not be physically accurate\&. It corresponds to the latency for accessing the memory of one node from a core in another node\&. The corresponding kind is \fBHWLOC_DISTANCES_KIND_FROM_OS\fP | \fBHWLOC_DISTANCES_KIND_FROM_USER\fP\&. The name of this distances structure is 'NUMALatency'\&. Others distance structures include and 'XGMIBandwidth', 'XGMIHops', 'XeLinkBandwidth' and 'NVLinkBandwidth'\&.
.PP
The matrix may also contain bandwidths between random sets of objects, possibly provided by the user, as specified in the \fCkind\fP attribute\&.
.PP
Pointers \fCobjs\fP and \fCvalues\fP should not be replaced, reallocated, freed, etc\&. However callers are allowed to modify \fCkind\fP as well as the contents of \fCobjs\fP and \fCvalues\fP arrays\&. For instance, if there is a single NUMA node per Package, \fBhwloc_get_obj_with_same_locality()\fP may be used to convert between them and replace NUMA nodes in the \fCobjs\fP array with the corresponding Packages\&. See also \fBhwloc_distances_transform()\fP for applying some transformations to the structure\&.

.PP
OR'ed set of \fBhwloc_distances_kind_e\fP\&. 
.SS "unsigned hwloc_distances_s::nbobjs"

.PP
Number of objects described by the distance matrix\&. 
.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP* hwloc_distances_s::objs"

.PP
Array of objects described by the distance matrix\&. These objects are not in any particular order, see \fBhwloc_distances_obj_index()\fP and \fBhwloc_distances_obj_pair_values()\fP for easy ways to find objects in this array and their corresponding values\&. 
.SS "hwloc_uint64_t* hwloc_distances_s::values"

.PP
Matrix of distances between objects, stored as a one-dimension array\&. Distance from i-th to j-th object is stored in slot i*nbobjs+j\&. The meaning of the value depends on the \fCkind\fP attribute\&.
