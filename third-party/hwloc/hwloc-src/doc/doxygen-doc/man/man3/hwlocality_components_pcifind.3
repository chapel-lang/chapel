.PP
Find the PCI device or bridge matching a PCI bus ID exactly\&. This is useful for adding specific information about some objects based on their PCI id\&. When it comes to attaching objects based on PCI locality, \fBhwloc_pci_find_parent_by_busid()\fP should be preferred\&. 
.SS "struct \fBhwloc_obj\fP * hwloc_pci_find_parent_by_busid (struct hwloc_topology * topology, unsigned domain, unsigned bus, unsigned dev, unsigned func)"

.PP
Find the object or a parent of a PCI bus ID\&. When attaching a new object (typically an OS device) whose locality is specified by PCI bus ID, this function returns the PCI object to use as a parent for attaching\&.
.PP
If the exact PCI device with this bus ID exists, it is returned\&. Otherwise (for instance if it was filtered out), the function returns another object with similar locality (for instance a parent bridge, or the local CPU Package)\&.
