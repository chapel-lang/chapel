.PP
Handle to a new distances structure during its addition to the topology\&.

.PP 
.SS "int hwloc_backend_distances_add_commit (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, \fBhwloc_backend_distances_add_handle_t\fP handle, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Commit a new distances structure\&. This is similar to \fBhwloc_distances_add_commit()\fP but this variant is designed for backend inserting distances during topology discovery\&. 
.SS "\fBhwloc_backend_distances_add_handle_t\fP hwloc_backend_distances_add_create (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, const char * name, unsigned long kind, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Create a new empty distances structure\&. This is identical to \fBhwloc_distances_add_create()\fP but this variant is designed for backend inserting distances during topology discovery\&. 
.SS "int hwloc_backend_distances_add_values (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, \fBhwloc_backend_distances_add_handle_t\fP handle, unsigned nbobjs, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP * objs, hwloc_uint64_t * values, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Specify the objects and values in a new empty distances structure\&. This is similar to \fBhwloc_distances_add_values()\fP but this variant is designed for backend inserting distances during topology discovery\&.
.PP
The only semantical difference is that \fCobjs\fP and \fCvalues\fP are not duplicated, but directly attached to the topology\&. On success, these arrays are given to the core and should not ever be freed by the caller anymore\&. 
.SS "struct \fBhwloc_obj\fP* hwloc_pci_find_by_busid (struct hwloc_topology * topology, unsigned domain, unsigned bus, unsigned dev, unsigned func)"

.PP
Find the PCI device or bridge matching a PCI bus ID exactly\&. This is useful for adding specific information about some objects based on their PCI id\&. When it comes to attaching objects based on PCI locality, \fBhwloc_pci_find_parent_by_busid()\fP should be preferred\&. 
.SS "struct \fBhwloc_obj\fP* hwloc_pci_find_parent_by_busid (struct hwloc_topology * topology, unsigned domain, unsigned bus, unsigned dev, unsigned func)"

.PP
Find the object or a parent of a PCI bus ID\&. When attaching a new object (typically an OS device) whose locality is specified by PCI bus ID, this function returns the PCI object to use as a parent for attaching\&.
.PP
If the exact PCI device with this bus ID exists, it is returned\&. Otherwise (for instance if it was filtered out), the function returns another object with similar locality (for instance a parent bridge, or the local CPU Package)\&.
