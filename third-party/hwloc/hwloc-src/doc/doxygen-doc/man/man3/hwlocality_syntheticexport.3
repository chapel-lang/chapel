\fB\fIHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_NO_EXTENDED_TYPES \fP\fP
Export extended types such as L2dcache as basic types such as Cache\&. This is required if loading the synthetic description with hwloc < 1\&.9\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_TOPOLOGY_EXPORT_SYNTHETIC_FLAG_NO_ATTRS \fP\fP
Do not export level attributes\&. Ignore level attributes such as memory/cache sizes or PU indexes\&. This is required if loading the synthetic description with hwloc < 1\&.10\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_export_synthetic (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, char * buffer, size_t buflen, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Export the topology as a synthetic string\&. At most \fCbuflen\fP characters will be written in \fCbuffer\fP, including the terminating \\0\&.
.PP
This exported string may be given back to \fBhwloc_topology_set_synthetic()\fP\&.
.PP
\fCflags\fP is a OR'ed set of hwloc_topology_export_synthetic_flags_e\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
The number of characters that were written, not including the terminating \\0\&.
.PP
-1 if the topology could not be exported, for instance if it is not symmetric\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
A 1024-byte buffer should be large enough for exporting topologies in the vast majority of cases\&.
