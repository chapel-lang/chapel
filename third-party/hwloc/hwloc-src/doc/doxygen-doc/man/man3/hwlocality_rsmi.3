.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
This interface offers ways to retrieve topology information about devices managed by the ROCm SMI Management Library\&.

.SS "static int hwloc_rsmi_get_device_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, uint32_t dv_ind, \fBhwloc_cpuset_t\fP set)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Get the CPU set of logical processors that are physically close to AMD GPU device whose index is \fCdv_ind\fP\&. Store in \fCset\fP the CPU-set describing the locality of the AMD GPU device whose index is \fCdv_ind\fP\&.
.PP
Topology \fCtopology\fP and device \fCdv_ind\fP must match the local machine\&. I/O devices detection and the ROCm SMI component are not needed in the topology\&.
.PP
The function only returns the locality of the device\&. If more information about the device is needed, OS objects should be used instead, see \fBhwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev()\fP and \fBhwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev_by_index()\fP\&.
.PP
This function is currently only implemented in a meaningful way for Linux; other systems will simply get a full cpuset\&. 
.SS "static \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_rsmi_get_device_osdev (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, uint32_t dv_ind)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to AMD GPU device, whose index is \fCdv_ind\fP\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The hwloc OS device object that describes the given AMD GPU, whose index is \fCdv_ind\fP\&. 
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if none could be found\&.
.RE
.PP
Topology \fCtopology\fP and device \fCdv_ind\fP must match the local machine\&. I/O devices detection and the ROCm SMI component must be enabled in the topology\&. If not, the locality of the object may still be found using \fBhwloc_rsmi_get_device_cpuset()\fP\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The corresponding hwloc PCI device may be found by looking at the result parent pointer (unless PCI devices are filtered out)\&.

.PP
Get the hwloc OS device object corresponding to the AMD GPU device whose index is \fCdv_ind\fP\&. 
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
The hwloc OS device object describing the AMD GPU device whose index is \fCdv_ind\fP\&. 
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if none could be found\&.
.RE
.PP
The topology \fCtopology\fP does not necessarily have to match the current machine\&. For instance the topology may be an XML import of a remote host\&. I/O devices detection and the ROCm SMI component must be enabled in the topology\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The corresponding PCI device object can be obtained by looking at the OS device parent object (unless PCI devices are filtered out)\&.
