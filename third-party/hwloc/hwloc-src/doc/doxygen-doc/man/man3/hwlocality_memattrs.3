.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Platforms with heterogeneous memory require ways to decide whether a buffer should be allocated on 'fast' memory (such as HBM), 'normal' memory (DDR) or even 'slow' but large-capacity memory (non-volatile memory)\&. These memory nodes are called 'Targets' while the CPU accessing them is called the 'Initiator'\&. Access performance depends on their locality (NUMA platforms) as well as the intrinsic performance of the targets (heterogeneous platforms)\&.
.PP
The following attributes describe the performance of memory accesses from an Initiator to a memory Target, for instance their latency or bandwidth\&. Initiators performing these memory accesses are usually some PUs or Cores (described as a CPU set)\&. Hence a Core may choose where to allocate a memory buffer by comparing the attributes of different target memory nodes nearby\&.
.PP
There are also some attributes that are system-wide\&. Their value does not depend on a specific initiator performing an access\&. The memory node Capacity is an example of such attribute without initiator\&.
.PP
One way to use this API is to start with a cpuset describing the Cores where a program is bound\&. The best target NUMA node for allocating memory in this program on these Cores may be obtained by passing this cpuset as an initiator to \fBhwloc_memattr_get_best_target()\fP with the relevant memory attribute\&. For instance, if the code is latency limited, use the Latency attribute\&.
.PP
A more flexible approach consists in getting the list of local NUMA nodes by passing this cpuset to \fBhwloc_get_local_numanode_objs()\fP\&. Attribute values for these nodes, if any, may then be obtained with \fBhwloc_memattr_get_value()\fP and manually compared with the desired criteria\&.
.PP
Memory attributes are also used internally to build Memory Tiers which provide an easy way to distinguish NUMA nodes of different kinds, as explained in \fBHeterogeneous Memory\fP\&.
.PP
Beside tiers, hwloc defines a set of 'default' nodes where normal memory allocations should be made from (see \fBhwloc_topology_get_default_nodeset()\fP)\&. This is also useful for dividing the machine into a set of non-overlapping NUMA domains, for instance for binding tasks per domain\&.
.PP
\fBSee also\fP
.RS 4
An example is available in doc/examples/memory-attributes\&.c in the source tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The API also supports specific objects as initiator, but it is currently not used internally by hwloc\&. Users may for instance use it to provide custom performance values for host memory accesses performed by GPUs\&.
.PP
The interface actually also accepts targets that are not NUMA nodes\&.

A memory attribute identifier\&. hwloc predefines some commonly-used attributes in \fBhwloc_memattr_id_e\fP\&. One may then dynamically register custom ones with \fBhwloc_memattr_register()\fP, they will be assigned IDs immediately after the predefined ones\&. See \fBManaging memory attributes\fP for more information about existing attribute IDs\&.

\fB\fIHWLOC_LOCAL_NUMANODE_FLAG_LARGER_LOCALITY \fP\fP
Select NUMA nodes whose locality is larger than the given cpuset\&. For instance, if a single PU (or its cpuset) is given in \fCinitiator\fP, select all nodes close to the package that contains this PU\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_LOCAL_NUMANODE_FLAG_SMALLER_LOCALITY \fP\fP

Select NUMA nodes whose locality intersects the given cpuset\&. This includes larger and smaller localities as well as localities that are partially included\&. For instance, if the locality is one core of both packages, a NUMA node local to one package is neither larger nor smaller than this locality, but it intersects it\&.

.PP
Return the set of default NUMA nodes\&. In machines with heterogeneous memory, some NUMA nodes are considered the default ones, i\&.e\&. where basic allocations should be made from\&. These are usually DRAM nodes\&.
.PP
Other nodes may be reserved for specific use (I/O device memory, e\&.g\&. GPU memory), small but high performance (HBM), large but slow memory (NVM), etc\&. Buffers should usually not be allocated from there unless explicitly required\&.
.PP
This function fills \fCnodeset\fP with the bits of NUMA nodes considered default\&.
.PP
It is guaranteed that these nodes have non-intersecting CPU sets, i\&.e\&. cores may not have multiple local NUMA nodes anymore\&. Hence this may be used to iterate over the platform divided into separate NUMA localities, for instance for binding one task per NUMA domain\&.
.PP
Any core that had some local NUMA node(s) in the initial topology should still have one in the default nodeset\&. Corner cases where this would be wrong consist in asymmetric platforms with missing DRAM nodes, or topologies that were already restricted to less NUMA nodes\&.
.PP
The returned nodeset may be passed to \fBhwloc_topology_restrict()\fP with \fBHWLOC_RESTRICT_FLAG_BYNODESET\fP to remove all non-default nodes from the topology\&. The resulting topology will be easier to use when iterating over (now homogeneous) NUMA nodes\&.
