.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Platforms with heterogeneous memory require ways to decide whether a buffer should be allocated on 'fast' memory (such as HBM), 'normal' memory (DDR) or even 'slow' but large-capacity memory (non-volatile memory)\&. These memory nodes are called 'Targets' while the CPU accessing them is called the 'Initiator'\&. Access performance depends on their locality (NUMA platforms) as well as the intrinsic performance of the targets (heterogeneous platforms)\&.
.PP
The following attributes describe the performance of memory accesses from an Initiator to a memory Target, for instance their latency or bandwidth\&. Initiators performing these memory accesses are usually some PUs or Cores (described as a CPU set)\&. Hence a Core may choose where to allocate a memory buffer by comparing the attributes of different target memory nodes nearby\&.
.PP
There are also some attributes that are system-wide\&. Their value does not depend on a specific initiator performing an access\&. The memory node Capacity is an example of such attribute without initiator\&.
.PP
One way to use this API is to start with a cpuset describing the Cores where a program is bound\&. The best target NUMA node for allocating memory in this program on these Cores may be obtained by passing this cpuset as an initiator to \fBhwloc_memattr_get_best_target()\fP with the relevant memory attribute\&. For instance, if the code is latency limited, use the Latency attribute\&.
.PP
A more flexible approach consists in getting the list of local NUMA nodes by passing this cpuset to \fBhwloc_get_local_numanode_objs()\fP\&. Attribute values for these nodes, if any, may then be obtained with \fBhwloc_memattr_get_value()\fP and manually compared with the desired criteria\&.
.PP
\fBSee also\fP
.RS 4
An example is available in doc/examples/memory-attributes\&.c in the source tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
The API also supports specific objects as initiator, but it is currently not used internally by hwloc\&. Users may for instance use it to provide custom performance values for host memory accesses performed by GPUs\&.
.PP
The interface actually also accepts targets that are not NUMA nodes\&.

\fB\fIHWLOC_LOCAL_NUMANODE_FLAG_LARGER_LOCALITY \fP\fP

\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMATTR_ID_CAPACITY \fP\fP
The "Capacity" is returned in bytes (local_memory attribute in objects)\&. Best capacity nodes are nodes with \fBhigher capacity\fP\&.

No initiator is involved when looking at this attribute\&. The corresponding attribute flags are \fBHWLOC_MEMATTR_FLAG_HIGHER_FIRST\fP\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMATTR_ID_LOCALITY \fP\fP
The "Locality" is returned as the number of PUs in that locality (e\&.g\&. the weight of its cpuset)\&. Best locality nodes are nodes with \fBsmaller locality\fP (nodes that are local to very few PUs)\&. Poor locality nodes are nodes with larger locality (nodes that are local to the entire machine)\&.
.PP
No initiator is involved when looking at this attribute\&. The corresponding attribute flags are \fBHWLOC_MEMATTR_FLAG_HIGHER_FIRST\fP\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMATTR_ID_BANDWIDTH \fP\fP
The "Bandwidth" is returned in MiB/s, as seen from the given initiator location\&. Best bandwidth nodes are nodes with \fBhigher bandwidth\fP\&.
.PP
The corresponding attribute flags are \fBHWLOC_MEMATTR_FLAG_HIGHER_FIRST\fP and \fBHWLOC_MEMATTR_FLAG_NEED_INITIATOR\fP\&.
.PP
This is the average bandwidth for read and write accesses\&. If the platform provides individual read and write bandwidths but no explicit average value, hwloc computes and returns the average\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMATTR_ID_READ_BANDWIDTH \fP\fP
The "ReadBandwidth" is returned in MiB/s, as seen from the given initiator location\&. Best bandwidth nodes are nodes with \fBhigher bandwidth\fP\&.

.TP

The "WriteBandwidth" is returned in MiB/s, as seen from the given initiator location\&. Best bandwidth nodes are nodes with \fBhigher bandwidth\fP\&.

.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_MEMATTR_ID_LATENCY \fP\fP
The "Latency" is returned as nanoseconds, as seen from the given initiator location\&. Best latency nodes are nodes with \fBsmaller latency\fP\&.
.PP
The corresponding attribute flags are \fBHWLOC_MEMATTR_FLAG_LOWER_FIRST\fP and \fBHWLOC_MEMATTR_FLAG_NEED_INITIATOR\fP\&.
.PP
This is the average latency for read and write accesses\&. If the platform provides individual read and write latencies but no explicit average value, hwloc computes and returns the average\&.

.SS "int hwloc_get_local_numanode_objs (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, struct \fBhwloc_location\fP * location, unsigned * nr, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP * nodes, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Return an array of local NUMA nodes\&. By default only select the NUMA nodes whose locality is exactly the given \fClocation\fP\&. More nodes may be selected if additional flags are given as a OR'ed set of \fBhwloc_local_numanode_flag_e\fP\&.
.PP
If \fClocation\fP is given as an explicit object, its CPU set is used to find NUMA nodes with the corresponding locality\&. If the object does not have a CPU set (e\&.g\&. I/O object), the CPU parent (where the I/O object is attached) is used\&.
.PP
On input, \fCnr\fP points to the number of nodes that may be stored in the \fCnodes\fP array\&. On output, \fCnr\fP will be changed to the number of stored nodes, or the number of nodes that would have been stored if there were enough room\&.
.PP
\fBNote\fP
.RS 4
Some of these NUMA nodes may not have any memory attribute values and hence not be reported as actual targets in other functions\&.
.PP
The number of NUMA nodes in the topology (obtained by \fBhwloc_bitmap_weight()\fP on the root object nodeset) may be used to allocate the \fCnodes\fP array\&.
.PP
When an object CPU set is given as locality, for instance a Package, and when flags contain both \fBHWLOC_LOCAL_NUMANODE_FLAG_LARGER_LOCALITY\fP and \fBHWLOC_LOCAL_NUMANODE_FLAG_SMALLER_LOCALITY\fP, the returned array corresponds to the nodeset of that object\&.
