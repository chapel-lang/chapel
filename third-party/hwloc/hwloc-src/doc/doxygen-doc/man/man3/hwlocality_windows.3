.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
These functions query Windows processor groups\&. These groups partition the operating system into virtual sets of up to 64 neighbor PUs\&. Threads and processes may only be bound inside a single group\&. Although Windows processor groups may be exposed in the hwloc hierarchy as hwloc Groups, they are also often merged into existing hwloc objects such as NUMA nodes or Packages\&. This API provides explicit information about Windows processor groups so that applications know whether binding to a large set of PUs may fail because it spans over multiple Windows processor groups\&.

.SS "int hwloc_windows_get_nr_processor_groups (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Get the number of Windows processor groups\&. \fCflags\fP must be 0 for now\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
at least \fC1\fP on success\&. 
.PP
-1 on error, for instance if the topology does not match the current system (e\&.g\&. loaded from another machine through XML)\&.

.SS "int hwloc_windows_get_processor_group_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP topology, unsigned pg_index, \fBhwloc_cpuset_t\fP cpuset, unsigned long flags)"

.PP
Get the CPU-set of a Windows processor group\&. Get the set of PU included in the processor group specified by \fCpg_index\fP\&. \fCpg_index\fP must be between \fC0\fP and the value returned by \fBhwloc_windows_get_nr_processor_groups()\fP minus 1\&.
.PP
\fCflags\fP must be 0 for now\&.
.PP
\fBReturns\fP
.RS 4
\fC0\fP on success\&. 
.PP
\fC-1\fP on error, for instance if \fCpg_index\fP is invalid, or if the topology does not match the current system (e\&.g\&. loaded from another machine through XML)\&.
