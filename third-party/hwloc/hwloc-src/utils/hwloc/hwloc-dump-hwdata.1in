\fB\-o <dir>\fR
save output files to directory <dir> instead of the default
\fI%RUNSTATEDIR%/hwloc/\fR that was specified at configure time.

You may want to set the HWLOC_DUMPED_HWDATA_DIR environment variable
as well so that the hwloc library looks for dumped files in that same
directory.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
hwloc may benefit from some locality and topology information from
SMBIOS or ACPI tables.
They are accessible from raw hardware files under directories such
/sys/firmware/dmi/ or /sys/firmware/acpi/ on Linux.
These files are usually only accessible to root,
and they only exist when there is \fIdmi-sysfs\fR support in the Linux kernel.
.
.PP
The hwloc-dump-hwdata tool dumps the useful contents of such files into
human-readable and world-accessible files. The intent is to run the tool
once during boot and have the main (non-privileged) hwloc library gather
information from these human-readable files.
.
.PP
\fBhwloc-dump-hwdata is currently only useful for Intel Xeon Phi processors\fR
(Knights Landing and Knights Mill).
.
.PP
The current list of dumped information is:
.
.TP 5
\fBIntel Xeon Phi processor memory, cache and clustering configuration\fR
gathered from specific SMBIOS entries such as
\fI/sys/firmware/dmi/entries/14-*\fR and
\fI/sys/firmware/dmi/entries/160-*\fR,
and saved in file \fIknl_memoryside_cache\fR.
