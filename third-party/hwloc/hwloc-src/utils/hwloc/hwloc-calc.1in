.SH TOPOLOGY OPTIONS
.
All topology options must be given before all other options.
.
.TP 10
\fB\-\-no\-smt\fR, \fB\-\-no\-smt=<N>\fR
Only keep the first PU per core in the input locations.
If \fI<N>\fR is specified, keep the <N>-th instead, if any.
PUs are ordered by physical index during this filtering.
.TP
\fB\-\-cpukind\fR <n>
\fB\-\-cpukind\fR <infoname>=<infovalue>
Only keep PUs whose CPU kind match.
Either a single CPU kind is specified as an index,
or the info name/value keypair will select matching kinds.

When specified by index, it corresponds to hwloc ranking of CPU kinds
which returns energy-efficient cores first, and high-performance
power-hungry cores last.
The full list of CPU kinds may be seen with \fIlstopo --cpukinds\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-restrict\fR <cpuset>
Restrict the topology to the given cpuset.
.TP
\fB\-\-restrict\fR nodeset=<nodeset>
Restrict the topology to the given nodeset, unless \fB\-\-restrict\-flags\fR specifies something different.
.TP
\fB\-\-restrict\-flags\fR <flags>
Enforce flags when restricting the topology.
Flags may be given as numeric values or as a comma-separated list of flag names
that are passed to \fIhwloc_topology_restrict()\fR.
Those names may be substrings of actual flag names as long as a single one matches,
for instance \fBbynodeset,memless\fR.
The default is \fB0\fR (or \fBnone\fR).
.TP
\fB\-\-disallowed\fR
Include objects disallowed by administrative limitations.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <path>, \fB\-\-input\fR <path>
Read the topology from <path> instead of discovering the topology of the local machine.

If <path> is a file and XML support has been compiled in hwloc,
it may be a XML file exported by a previous hwloc program.
If <path> is "\-", the standard input may be used as a XML file.

On Linux, <path> may be a directory containing the topology files
gathered from another machine topology with hwloc-gather-topology.

On x86, <path> may be a directory containing a cpuid dump gathered
with hwloc-gather-cpuid.

When the archivemount program is available, <path> may also be a tarball
containing such Linux or x86 topology files.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <specification>, \fB\-\-input\fR <specification>
Simulate a fake hierarchy (instead of discovering the topology on the
local machine). If <specification> is "node:2 pu:3", the topology will
contain two NUMA nodes with 3 processing units in each of them.
The <specification> string must end with a number of PUs.
.TP
\fB\-\-if\fR <format>, \fB\-\-input\-format\fR <format>
Enforce the input in the given format, among \fBxml\fR, \fBfsroot\fR,
\fBcpuid\fR and \fBsynthetic\fR.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.
All these options must be given after all topology options above.
.
.TP 10
\fB\-p\fR \fB\-\-physical\fR
Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes for both input and output.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR \fB\-\-logical\fR
Use logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes for both input and output (default).
.TP
\fB\-\-pi\fR \fB\-\-physical\-input\fR
Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes for input.
.TP
\fB\-\-li\fR \fB\-\-logical\-input\fR
Use logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes for input (default).
.TP
\fB\-\-po\fR \fB\-\-physical\-output\fR
Use OS/physical indexes instead of logical indexes for output.
.TP
\fB\-\-lo\fR \fB\-\-logical\-output\fR
Use logical indexes instead of physical/OS indexes for output (default, except for cpusets which are always physical).
.TP
\fB\-n\fR \fB\-\-nodeset\fR
Interpret both input and output sets as nodesets instead of CPU sets.
See \fB\-\-nodeset\-output\fR and \fB\-\-nodeset\-input\fR below for details.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\fR \fB\-\-nodeset\-output\fR
Report nodesets instead of CPU sets.
This output is more precise than the default CPU set output when memory
locality matters because it properly describes CPU-less NUMA nodes,
as well as NUMA-nodes that are local to multiple CPUs.
.TP
\fB\-\-ni\fR \fB\-\-nodeset\-input\fR
Interpret input sets as nodesets instead of CPU sets.
.TP
\fB\-N \-\-number\-of <type|depth>\fR
Report the number of objects of the given type or depth that intersect the CPU set.
This is convenient for finding how many cores, NUMA nodes or PUs are available
in a machine.

When combined with \fB\-\-nodeset\fR or \fB\-\-nodeset-output\fR,
the nodeset is considered instead of the CPU set for finding matching objects.
This is useful when reporting the output as a number or set of NUMA nodes.

If an OS device subtype such as \fIgpu\fR  is given instead of \fIosdev\fR,
only the os devices of that subtype will be counted.
.TP
\fB\-I \-\-intersect <type|depth>\fR
Find the list of objects of the given type or depth that intersect the CPU set and
report the comma-separated list of their indexes instead of the cpu mask string.
This may be used for determining the list of objects above or below the input
objects.

When combined with \fB\-\-physical\fR, the list is convenient to pass to external
tools such as taskset or numactl \fB\-\-physcpubind\fR or \fB\-\-membind\fR.
This is different from \-\-largest since the latter requires that all reported
objects are strictly included inside the input objects.

When combined with \fB\-\-nodeset\fR or \fB\-\-nodeset-output\fR,
the nodeset is considered instead of the CPU set for finding matching objects.
This is useful when reporting the output as a number or set of NUMA nodes.

If an OS device subtype such as \fIgpu\fR is given instead of \fIosdev\fR,
only the os devices of that subtype will be returned.
.TP
\fB\-H \-\-hierarchical <type1>.<type2>...\fR
Find the list of objects of type <type2> that intersect the CPU set and
report the space-separated list of their hierarchical indexes with respect
to <type1>, <type2>, etc.
For instance, if \fIpackage.core\fR is given, the output would be
\fIPackage:1.Core:2 Package:2.Core:3\fR if the input contains the third
core of the second package and the fourth core of the third package.

Only normal CPU-side object types should be used.

NUMA nodes may be used but they may cause redundancy in the output
on heterogeneous memory platform. For instance, on a platform with both
DRAM and HBM memory on a package, the first core will be considered both
as first core of first NUMA node (DRAM) and
as first core of second NUMA node (HBM).
.TP
\fB\-\-largest\fR
Report (in a human readable format) the list of largest objects which exactly
include all input objects (by looking at their CPU sets).
None of these output objects intersect each other, and the sum of them is
exactly equivalent to the input. No largest object is included in the input
This is different from \-\-intersect where reported objects may not be
strictly included in the input.
.TP
\fB\-\-local\-memory\fR
Report the list of NUMA nodes that are local to the input objects.

This option is similar to \fB\-I numa\fR but the way nodes are selected
is different:
The selection performed by \fB\-\-local\-memory\fR may be precisely
configured with \fB\-\-local\-memory\-flags\fR,
while \fB\-I numa\fR just selects all nodes that are somehow local to
any of the input objects.
.TP
\fB\-\-local\-memory\-flags\fR
Change the flags used to select local NUMA nodes.
Flags may be given as numeric values or as a comma-separated list of flag names
that are passed to \fIhwloc_get_local_numanode_objs()\fR.
Those names may be substrings of actual flag names as long as a single one matches.
The default is \fB3\fR (or \fBsmaller,larger\fR)
which means NUMA nodes are displayed
if their locality either contains or is contained
in the locality of the given object.

This option enables \fB\-\-local\-memory\fR.
.TP
\fB\-\-best\-memattr\fR <name>
Enable the listing of local memory nodes with \fB\-\-local\-memory\fR,
but only display the local node that has the best value for the memory
attribute given by \fI<name>\fR (or as an index).

If the memory attribute values depend on the initiator, the hwloc-calc
input objects are used as the initiator.

Standard attribute names are \fICapacity\fR, \fILocality\fR,
\fIBandwidth\fR, and \fILatency\fR.
All existing attributes in the current topology may be listed with

    $ lstopo --memattrs

.TP
\fB\-\-sep <sep>\fR
Change the field separator in the output.
By default, a space is used to separate output objects
(for instance when \fB\-\-hierarchical\fR or \fB\-\-largest\fR is given)
while a comma is used to separate indexes
(for instance when \fB\-\-intersect\fR is given).
.TP
\fB\-\-single\fR
Singlify the output to a single CPU.
.TP
\fB\-\-taskset\fR
Display CPU set strings in the format recognized by the taskset command-line
program instead of hwloc-specific CPU set string format.
This option has no impact on the format of input CPU set strings,
both formats are always accepted.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Hide non-fatal error messages.
It mostly includes locations pointing to non-existing objects.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Verbose output.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Report version and exit.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR \fB\-\-help\fR
Display help message and exit.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.
hwloc-calc generates and manipulates CPU mask strings or objects.
Both input and output may be either objects (with physical or logical
indexes), CPU lists (with physical or logical indexes), or CPU mask strings
(always physically indexed).
Input location specification is described in hwloc(7).
.
.PP
If objects or CPU mask strings are given on the command-line,
they are combined and a single output is printed.
If no object or CPU mask strings are given on the command-line,
the program will read the standard input.
It will combine multiple objects or CPU mask strings that are
given on the same line of the standard input line with spaces
as separators.
Different input lines will be processed separately.
.
.PP
Command-line arguments and options are processed in order.
First topology configuration options should be given.
Then, for instance, changing the type of input indexes
with \fB\-\-li\fR or changing the input topology with \fB\-i\fR
only affects the processing the following arguments.
.
.PP
.B NOTE:
It is highly recommended that you read the hwloc(7) overview page
before reading this man page.  Most of the concepts described in
hwloc(7) directly apply to the hwloc-calc utility.
.

.\" **************************
.\"    Examples Section
.\" **************************
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
hwloc-calc's operation is best described through several examples.
.
.PP
To display the (physical) CPU mask corresponding to the second package:

    $ hwloc-calc package:1
    0x000000f0

To display the (physical) CPU mask corresponding to the third pacakge, excluding
its even numbered logical processors:

    $ hwloc-calc package:2 ~PU:even
    0x00000c00

To convert a cpu mask to human-readable output, the -H option can be
used to emit a space-delimited list of locations:

    $ echo 0x000000f0 | hwloc-calc -H package.core
    Package:1.Core1 Package:1.Core:1 Package:1.Core:2 Package:1.Core:3

To use some other character (e.g., a comma) instead of spaces in
output, use the --sep option:

    $ echo 0x000000f0 | hwloc-calc -H package.core --sep ,
    Package:1.Core1,Package:1.Core:1,Package:1.Core:2,Package:1.Core:3

To combine two (physical) CPU masks:

    $ hwloc-calc 0x0000ffff 0xff000000
    0xff00ffff

To display the list of logical numbers of processors included in the second
package:

    $ hwloc-calc --intersect PU package:1
    4,5,6,7

To bind GNU OpenMP threads logically over the whole machine, we need to use
physical number output instead:

    $ export GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=`hwloc-calc --physical-output --intersect PU all`
    $ echo $GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY
    0,4,1,5,2,6,3,7

To display the list of NUMA nodes, by physical indexes, that intersect a given (physical) CPU mask:

    $ hwloc-calc --physical --intersect NUMAnode 0xf0f0f0f0
    0,2

To find how many cores are in the second CPU kind
(those cores are likely higher-performance and more power-hungry than cores of the first kind):

    $ hwloc-calc --cpukind 1 -N core all
    4

To display the list of NUMA nodes, by physical indexes,
whose locality is exactly equal to a Package:

    $ hwloc-calc --local-memory-flags 0 pack:1
    4,7

To display the best-capacity NUMA node, by physical indexe,
whose locality is exactly equal to a Package:

    $ hwloc-calc --local-memory-flags 0 --best-memattr capacity pack:1
    4

Converting object logical indexes (default) from/to physical/OS indexes
may be performed with \fB--intersect\fR combined with either \fB--physical-output\fR
(logical to physical conversion) or \fB--physical-input\fR (physical to logical):

    $ hwloc-calc --physical-output PU:2 --intersect PU
    3
    $ hwloc-calc --physical-input PU:3 --intersect PU
    2

One should add \fB--nodeset\fR when converting indexes of memory objects
to make sure a single NUMA node index is returned on platforms
with heterogeneous memory:

    $ hwloc-calc --nodeset --physical-output node:2 --intersect node
    3
    $ hwloc-calc --nodeset --physical-input node:3 --intersect node
    2

To display the set of CPUs near network interface eth0:

    $ hwloc-calc os=eth0
    0x00005555

To display the indexes of packages near PCI device whose bus ID is 0000:01:02.0:

    $ hwloc-calc pci=0000:01:02.0 --intersect Package
    1

To display the list of per-package cores that intersect the input:

    $ hwloc-calc 0x00003c00 --hierarchical package.core
    Package:2.Core:1 Package:3.Core:0

To display the (physical) CPU mask of the entire topology except the third package:

    $ hwloc-calc all ~package:3
    0x0000f0ff

To combine both physical and logical indexes as input:

    $ hwloc-calc PU:2 --physical-input PU:3
    0x0000000c

To synthetize a set of cores into largest objects on a 2-node 2-package 2-core machine:

    $ hwloc-calc core:0 --largest
    Core:0
    $ hwloc-calc core:0-1 --largest
    Package:0
    $ hwloc-calc core:4-7 --largest
    NUMANode:1
    $ hwloc-calc core:2-6 --largest
    Package:1 Package:2 Core:6
    $ hwloc-calc pack:2 --largest
    Package:2
    $ hwloc-calc package:2-3 --largest
    NUMANode:1

To get the set of first threads of all cores:

    $ hwloc-calc core:all.pu:0
    $ hwloc-calc --no-smt all

This can also be very useful in order to make GNU OpenMP use exactly one thread
per core, and in logical core order:

    $ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=`hwloc-calc --number-of core all`
    $ echo $OMP_NUM_THREADS
    4
    $ export GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=`hwloc-calc --physical-output --intersect PU --no-smt all`
    $ echo $GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY
    0,2,1,3

To export bitmask in a format that is acceptable by the resctrl Linux subsystem
(for configuring cache partitioning, etc), apply a sed regexp to the output of hwloc-calc:

    $ hwloc-calc pack:all.core:7-9.pu:0
    0x00000380,,0x00000380   <this format cannot be given to resctrl>
    $ hwloc-calc pack:all.core:7-9.pu:0 | sed -e 's/0x//g' -e 's/,,/,0,/g' -e 's/,,/,0,/g'
    00000380,0,00000380
    # echo 00000380,0,00000380 > /sys/fs/resctrl/test/cpus
    # cat /sys/fs/resctrl/test/cpus
    00000000,00000380,00000000,00000380   <the modified bitmask was corrected parsed by resctrl>

OS devices may also be filtered by subtype. In this example, there are
8 OS devices in the system, 4 of them are near NUMA node #1, and only
2 of these are CoProcessors:

    $ utils/hwloc/hwloc-calc -I osdev all
    0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
    $ utils/hwloc/hwloc-calc -I osdev node:1
    5,6,7,8
    $ utils/hwloc/hwloc-calc -I coproc node:1
    7,8
