.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Hwloc uses bitmaps to represent two distinct kinds of object sets: CPU sets (\fBhwloc_cpuset_t\fP) and NUMA node sets (\fBhwloc_nodeset_t\fP)\&. These types are both typedefs to a common back end type (\fBhwloc_bitmap_t\fP), and therefore all the hwloc bitmap functions are applicable to both \fBhwloc_cpuset_t\fP and \fBhwloc_nodeset_t\fP (see \fBThe bitmap API\fP)\&.
.PP
The rationale for having two different types is that even though the actions one wants to perform on these types are the same (e\&.g\&., enable and disable individual items in the set/mask), they're used in very different contexts: one for specifying which processors to use and one for specifying which NUMA nodes to use\&. Hence, the name difference is really just to reflect the intent of where the type is used\&.

A CPU set is a bitmap whose bits are set according to CPU physical OS indexes\&. It may be consulted and modified with the bitmap API as any \fBhwloc_bitmap_t\fP (see \fBhwloc/bitmap\&.h\fP)\&.

.PP
A node set is a bitmap whose bits are set according to NUMA memory node physical OS indexes\&. It may be consulted and modified with the bitmap API as any \fBhwloc_bitmap_t\fP (see \fBhwloc/bitmap\&.h\fP)\&.
.PP
When binding memory on a system without any NUMA node (when the whole memory is considered as a single memory bank), the nodeset may be either empty (no memory selected) or full (whole system memory selected)\&.
