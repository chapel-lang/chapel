.PP 
.SS "void hwloc_obj_add_info (\fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, const char *name, const char *value)"

.PP
Add the given info name and value pair to the given object\&. The info is appended to the existing info array even if another key with the same name already exists\&.
.PP
The input strings are copied before being added in the object infos\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This function may be used to enforce object colors in the lstopo graphical output by using 'lstopoStyle' as a name and 'Background=#rrggbb' as a value\&. See CUSTOM COLORS in the lstopo(1) manpage for details\&.
.PP
If \fCvalue\fP contains some non-printable characters, they will be dropped when exporting to XML, see \fBhwloc_topology_export_xml()\fP\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_obj_attr_snprintf (char *restrictstring, size_tsize, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, const char *restrictseparator, intverbose)"

.PP
Stringify the attributes of a given topology object into a human-readable form\&. Attribute values are separated by \fCseparator\fP\&.
.PP
Only the major attributes are printed in non-verbose mode\&.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0)\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_obj_cpuset_snprintf (char *restrictstr, size_tsize, size_tnobj, const \fBhwloc_obj_t\fP *restrictobjs)"

.PP
Stringify the cpuset containing a set of objects\&. If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0)\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "static const char* hwloc_obj_get_info_by_name (\fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, const char *name)\fC [inline]\fP, \fC [static]\fP"

.PP
Search the given key name in object infos and return the corresponding value\&. If multiple keys match the given name, only the first one is returned\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
\fCNULL\fP if no such key exists\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_obj_type_snprintf (char *restrictstring, size_tsize, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fPobj, intverbose)"

.PP
Stringify the type of a given topology object into a human-readable form\&. It differs from \fBhwloc_obj_type_string()\fP because it prints type attributes such as cache depth and type\&.
.PP
If \fCsize\fP is 0, \fCstring\fP may safely be \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the number of character that were actually written if not truncating, or that would have been written (not including the ending \\0)\&.

.PP

.SS "int hwloc_obj_type_sscanf (const char *string, \fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fP *typep, int *depthattrp, void *typeattrp, size_ttypeattrsize)"

.PP
Return an object type and attributes from a type string\&. Convert strings such as 'socket' or 'cache' into the corresponding types\&. Matching is case-insensitive, and only the first letters are actually required to match\&.
.PP
Types that have specific attributes, for instance caches and groups, may be returned in \fCdepthattrp\fP and \fCtypeattrp\fP\&. They are ignored when these pointers are \fCNULL\fP\&.
.PP
For instance 'L2i' or 'L2iCache' would return type HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE in \fCtypep\fP, 2 in \fCdepthattrp\fP, and HWLOC_OBJ_CACHE_TYPE_INSTRUCTION in \fCtypeattrp\fP (this last pointer should point to a hwloc_obj_cache_type_t)\&. 'Group3' would return type HWLOC_OBJ_GROUP type and 3 in \fCdepthattrp\fP\&. Attributes that are not specified in the string (for instance 'Group' without a depth, or 'L2Cache' without a cache type) are set to -1\&.
.PP
\fCtypeattrd\fP is only filled if the size specified in \fCtypeattrsize\fP is large enough\&. It is currently only used for caches, and the required size is at least the size of hwloc_obj_cache_type_t\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 if a type was correctly identified, otherwise -1\&.

.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This is an extended version of the now deprecated hwloc_obj_type_of_string()

.PP

.SS "const char* hwloc_obj_type_string (\fBhwloc_obj_type_t\fPtype)"

.PP
Return a stringified topology object type\&.
