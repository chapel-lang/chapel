hwloc README for Chapel
=======================

This copy of hwloc 1.11.13 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from:

  https://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc/

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to hwloc should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.


Upgrading hwloc versions
========================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/hwloc/hwloc-src/ contains the
un-tarballed hwloc package contents. Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/hwloc/:

1. download and untar the latest hwloc 1.X version: e.g. hwloc-1.11.13
2. `rm -rf hwloc-src`
3. `mv hwloc-1.11.13 hwloc-src`
4. `git add --force hwloc-src` (--force to ignore our .gitignore)
5. update the version number mentioned above
6. update the okversions whitelist in chpl_hwloc.py
7. make sure these instructions are up to date :)
8. test (std config, and that stream gets expected performance)
9. commit, PR, merge, etc

Note that these instructions are for simple 1.X API compatible updates.
If the hwloc API changes, the runtime shim may need to be changed and
incompatible versions need to be dropped from the whitelist.
