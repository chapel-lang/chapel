.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_RESTRICT_FLAG_ADAPT_DISTANCES \fP\fP
Adapt distance matrices according to objects being removed during restriction\&. If this flag is not set, distance matrices are removed\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_RESTRICT_FLAG_ADAPT_MISC \fP\fP
Move Misc objects to ancestors if their parents are removed during restriction\&. If this flag is not set, Misc objects are removed when their parents are removed\&. 
.TP
\fB\fIHWLOC_RESTRICT_FLAG_ADAPT_IO \fP\fP
Move I/O objects to ancestors if their parents are removed during restriction\&. If this flag is not set, I/O devices and bridges are removed when their parents are removed\&.

.SS "int hwloc_topology_dup (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP *newtopology, \fBhwloc_topology_t\fPoldtopology)"

.PP
Duplicate a topology\&. The entire topology structure as well as its objects are duplicated into a new one\&.
.PP
This is useful for keeping a backup while modifying a topology\&. 
.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object_by_cpuset (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology, \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fPcpuset, const char *name)"

.PP
Add a MISC object to the topology\&. A new MISC object will be created and inserted into the topology at the position given by bitmap \fCcpuset\fP\&. This offers a way to add new intermediate levels to the topology hierarchy\&.
.PP
\fCcpuset\fP and \fCname\fP will be copied to setup the new object attributes\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP

the newly-created object\&. 
.PP
\fCNULL\fP if the insertion conflicts with the existing topology tree\&.

.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
If \fCname\fP contains some non-printable characters, they will be dropped when exporting to XML, see \fBhwloc_topology_export_xml()\fP\&.

.SS "\fBhwloc_obj_t\fP hwloc_topology_insert_misc_object_by_parent (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology, \fBhwloc_obj_t\fPparent, const char *name)"

.PP
Add a MISC object as a leaf of the topology\&. A new MISC object will be created and inserted into the topology at the position given by parent\&. It is appended to the list of existing children, without ever adding any intermediate hierarchy level\&. This is useful for annotating the topology without actually changing the hierarchy\&.
.PP
\fCname\fP will be copied to the setup the new object attributes\&. However, the new leaf object will not have any \fCcpuset\fP\&.
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
the newly-created object

.SS "int hwloc_topology_restrict (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP restricttopology, \fBhwloc_const_cpuset_t\fPcpuset, unsigned longflags)"

.PP
Restrict the topology to the given CPU set\&. Topology \fCtopology\fP is modified so as to remove all objects that are not included (or partially included) in the CPU set \fCcpuset\fP\&. All objects CPU and node sets are restricted accordingly\&.
.PP
\fCflags\fP is a OR'ed set of \fBhwloc_restrict_flags_e\fP\&.
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This call may not be reverted by restricting back to a larger cpuset\&. Once dropped during restriction, objects may not be brought back, except by loading another topology with \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success\&.
.PP
-1 with errno set to EINVAL if the input cpuset is invalid\&. The topology is not modified in this case\&.
.PP
-1 with errno set to ENOMEM on failure to allocate internal data\&. The topology is reinitialized in this case\&. It should be either destroyed with \fBhwloc_topology_destroy()\fP or configured and loaded again\&.
