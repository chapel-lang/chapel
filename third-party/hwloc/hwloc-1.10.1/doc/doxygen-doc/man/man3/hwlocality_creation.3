.SS "typedef struct hwloc_topology* \fBhwloc_topology_t\fP"

.PP
Topology context\&. To be initialized with \fBhwloc_topology_init()\fP and built with \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP\&. 
.SH "Function Documentation"
.PP 
.SS "void hwloc_topology_check (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)"

.PP
Run internal checks on a topology structure\&. The program aborts if an inconsistency is detected in the given topology\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItopology\fP is the topology to be checked
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
This routine is only useful to developers\&.
.PP
The input topology should have been previously loaded with \fBhwloc_topology_load()\fP\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "void hwloc_topology_destroy (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)"

.PP
Terminate and free a topology context\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItopology\fP is the topology to be freed 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_topology_init (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fP *topologyp)"

.PP
Allocate a topology context\&. 
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItopologyp\fP is assigned a pointer to the new allocated context\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, -1 on error\&. 
.RE
.PP

.SS "int hwloc_topology_load (\fBhwloc_topology_t\fPtopology)"

.PP
Build the actual topology\&. Build the actual topology once initialized with \fBhwloc_topology_init()\fP and tuned with \fBTopology Detection Configuration and Query\fP routines\&. No other routine may be called earlier using this topology context\&.
.PP
\fBParameters:\fP
.RS 4
\fItopology\fP is the topology to be loaded with objects\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBReturns:\fP
.RS 4
0 on success, -1 on error\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBNote:\fP
.RS 4
On failure, the topology is reinitialized\&. It should be either destroyed with \fBhwloc_topology_destroy()\fP or configured and loaded again\&.
.PP
This function may be called only once per topology\&.
