make_dparser \- D Parser Generator
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B make_dparser
[\fIoptions\fP] \fIgrammar\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
make_dparser is a scannerless GLR parser generator based on the Tomita
algorithm. It is self-hosted and very easy to use. Grammars are written in a
natural style of EBNF and regular expressions and support both speculative and
final actions.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.IP "-l"
Toggle longest match lexical ambiguity resolution.
When ON the scanner only recognizing the longest matching tokens
in a given state. This provides an easy way to build
grammars for languages which use longest match lexical
ambiguity resolution (e.g. ANSI-C, C++). (OFF by default)
.IP "-T"
Toggle building of a tokenizer for START.  When ON, instead of generating 
a unique scanner for each state (i.e. a 'scannerless' parser), 
generate a single scanner (tokenizer) for the entire grammar.  This provides
an easy way to build grammars for languages which assume a
tokenizer (e.g. ANSI C). (OFF by default)
.IP "-H \fI-1/0/1\fP"
Write header, 0 : no, 1 : yes, -1 : only if not empty.
.IP "-t \fI0/1\fP"
Token type, 0 : #define, 1 : enum.
.IP "-C"
Toggle computing whitespace states.  If 'whitespace' is
defined in the grammar, then use it as a subparser to 
consume whitespace. (ON by default)
.IP "-A"
Toggle computing states for all non-terminals.  Ensures that there is a unique
state for each non-terminal so that a subparsers can be invoked for
that non-terminal. (OFF by default)
.IP "-i \fItag\fP"
Tag for grammar data structures so that multiple sets of tables can
be included in one file/application. (defaults to 'gram')
.IP "-b \fIblocks\fP"
Number of blocks to which scanner tables are broken up into.
Larger numbers permit more sharing with more overhead.  4 seems to be optimal
for most grammars. (defaults to 4)
files.
.IP "-p"
Toggle setting of operator priority from rules.  Setting of operator
priorities on operator tokens can increase the size of the tables but 
can permit unnecessary parse stacks to be pruned earlier. (OFF by default)
.IP "-r"
Toggle use of right recursion for EBNF productions.  Do not change this
unless you really know what you are doing. (OFF by default) 
.IP "-L"
Toggle writing of line numbers.  Used to debug the parsing table
generator itself. (ON by default)
.IP "-X"
Set the extension of the generated code file.  For C++ programs (for example)
the extension can be set to .cpp with the option "-Xcpp".  ("-Xc" by default)
.IP "-v"
Increase verbosity.
.IP "-d"
Increase debugging.
.IP "-h"
Display help.
