Chapel modifications to Qthreads
================================

The modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads release are
as follows:

* We force tasks being woken from sync vars to run on their original
  shepherd. This is to work around a task serialization bug that stems
  from us using schedulers that don't support work stealing (nemesis)
  or running with work stealing disabled (distrib w/ QT_STEAL_RATIO=0)

* We added a simple mechanism to reset the automatic task spawning
  order for better affinity between consecutive parallel loops.

* Pulled in an upstream fix for the binders topology layer.
  https://github.com/Qthreads/qthreads/pull/82

* Pulled in an upstream fix for handling signals during configure.
  https://github.com/Qthreads/qthreads/pull/84

* Pulled in an upstream --with-hwloc-symbol-prefix configuration option.
  https://github.com/Qthreads/qthreads/pull/87

* Pulled in an upstream fix for errno with syscalls.
  https://github.com/Qthreads/qthreads/pull/89
