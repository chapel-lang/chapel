Qthreads README for Chapel
==========================

This copy of Qthreads 1.21 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from:

  https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to Qthreads should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.


Upgrading qthread versions
============================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/qthread/qthread-src contains the
un-tarballed qthread package contents. Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/qthread/:

1. download the latest qthread version: e.g. `wget https://github.com/sandialabs/qthreads/releases/download/1.21/qthreads-1.21.tar.gz`
2. `tar xf qthreads-1.21.tar.gz`
3. `git rm -r qthread-src`
4. `mv qthreads-1.21 qthread-src`
5. `git add --force qthread-src` (--force to ignore our .gitignore)
6. update the version number mentioned above
7. test
8. commit, PR, merge, etc

Chapel modifications to Qthreads
================================

The modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads release are
as follows:

* Do not #include "qthread.hpp" ifdef CHPL_AVOID_CPP_CODE
