Chapel modifications to Qthreads
================================

The modifications that we have made to the official Qthreads release are
as follows:

* We force tasks being woken from sync vars to run on their original
  shepherd. This is to work around a task serialization bug that stems
  from us using schedulers that don't support work stealing (nemesis)
  or running with work stealing disabled (distrib w/ QT_STEAL_RATIO=0)

* We added a simple mechanism to reset the automatic task spawning
  order for better affinity between consecutive parallel loops.

* Pulled in an upstream fix for build errors on Alpine linux
  https://github.com/Qthreads/qthreads/pull/105

* We modified the configuration to support the
  --with-hwloc-get-topology-function argument that specifies a function that
  qthreads should call to get the hwloc topology, and several files to
  support this behavior including the Makefile to pass this argument to
  configure, and binders.c and hwloc.c to call the function.

* We added --disable-hwloc-configure-checks to disable hwloc link checks,
  and --disable-hwloc-has-distance to specify whether or not hwloc supports
  distance information.
