.SH NAME
.B qthread_readstate
\- returns status information from the runtime
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread.h>

.I size_t
.br
.B qthread_readstate
.RI "(const enum introspective_state " type );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function is for querying the runtime about itself. The
.I type
argument specifies what information is desired. The valid values of
.I type
include:
.TP 4
STACK_SIZE
This causes the function to return the size stack, measured in bytes, that all
spawned qthreads receive.
.TP
RUNTIME_DATA_SIZE
This causes the function to return the size of the runtime data structure that
all spawned qthreads require.
.TP
BUSYNESS
This causes the function to return the approximate number of threads available
in the run queue of the current shepherd.
.TP
ACTIVE_SHEPHERDS
This causes the function to return the number of shepherds currently active and
scheduling threads. This is equivalent to the function
.BR qthread_num_shepherds ().
.TP
TOTAL_SHEPHERDS
This causes the funciton to return the total number of shepherds that exist,
whether active or inactive.
.TP
ACTIVE_WORKERS
This causes the function to return the number of worker threads currently
active and scheduling threads. This is equivalent to the function
.BR qthread_num_workers ().
.TP
TOTAL_WORKERS
This causes the function to return the total number of worker threads that
exist, whether active or inactive.
.TP
CURRENT_WORKER
This causes the function to return the ID of the current worker on which the
task is executing. This is equivalent to the function
.BR qthread_worker ().
.TP
CURRENT_TEAM
This causes the function to return the ID of the calling task's team. This is
equivalent to the function
.BR qt_team_id ().
.TP
PARENT_TEAM
This causes the function to return the ID of the calling task's team's
parent-team, if it had one. This is equivalent to the function
.BR qt_team_parent_id ().
