.SH DESCRIPTION
This is the master function for generating and scheduling new tasks. All other
functions that spawn tasks, particularly those beginning with the string
"qthread_fork", are fundamentally convenience wrapper functions around this
function.
.PP
The first argument,
.IR f ,
is a function that will be run to completion as the created task. The qthread_f
function must have a prototype like this:
.RS
.PP
aligned_t function(void *arg);
.RE
.PP
The second
argument,
.IR arg ,
is an argument for the function. The treatment of this pointer depends on the value of the third argument,
.IR arg_size .
If
.I arg_size
is zero, the pointer will be passed to the function
.I f
unchanged. However, if
.I arg_size is non-zero, then
.I arg_size
bytes will be copied from
.I arg
and stored in task-specific memory. This memory is usually pre-allocated (unless
.I arg_size
is very large), so the performance is limited primarily by the speed of
.BR memcpy ().
When
.I f
is called, a pointer to the copy will be passed as the argument to
.I f
instead of the original value of
.IR arg .
.PP
The fourth argument,
.IR ret ,
is a pointer indicating where to store the return value of
.IR f .
This location may be an aligned_t, a syncvar_t, or a qt_sinc_t, and the type is indicated with flags passed in the
.I feature_flags
argument. The location may also be NULL. If the type is an aligned_t, the return value location is emptied by
.BR qthread_spawn ()
and is stored by calling
.BR qthread_writeF ()
when the task returns. If the type is a syncvar_t, the return value location is emptied by
.BR qthread_spawn ()
and is stored by calling
.BR qthread_syncvar_writeF ()
when the task returns. If the type is a qt_sinc_t, when the task returns, the function
.BR qt_sinc_submit ()
is called on the sinc. If so configured (by passing the flag
.B QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_SINC_VOID
to the
.I feature_flag
argument), return value is submitted to the sinc.
.PP
The fifth and sixth arguments,
.IR npreconds " and " preconds ,
are for creating "preconditioned" tasks, also sometimes referred to as "data-dependent" tasks or "triggered" tasks. The
.I preconds
argument is expected to be an array of
.I npreconds
pointers either to aligned_t's or syncvar_t's (depending on the flags passed to the
.I feature_flag
argument). The task will be scheduled only when all of the preconditions have
been in the relevant "full" state at least once. The preconditions are queried
in an undefined order, so preconditions that can return to the empty state
before the task is spawned create undefined behavior.
.PP
The seventh argument,
.IR target_shep ,
specifies a destination shepherd for the task. The task will only ever execute
on the specified shepherd unless that shepherd is disabled. If the task should be able to execute anywhere, use the pre-defined constant NO_SHEPHERD to specify the lack of preference.
.PP
The eighth argument,
.IR feature_flag ,
is a way of passing additional flags to control task behavior. The available
flags are as follows:
.TP 4
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_SIMPLE
This flag specifies that the task spawned will not block. Violations of this promise will cause the program to abort. In exchange for making this promise, the runtime can avoid a great deal of context-swap overhead and can provide the task with much more stack space for "free" (it uses the worker thread's stack).
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_NEW_TEAM
Tasks are, by default, spawned into their parent's team. This flag specifies that the spawned task will be the founding member of a new task team and not a member of the calling task's team. Task teams are collections of tasks. Any task that performs a readFF() operation on the return value location of a task that is the founding member of a task team will not be unblocked until all of the tasks in that team also return.
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_NEW_SUBTEAM
This flag specifies that the spawned task will be the founding member of a new task team that is dependent upon the calling task's team, but not a member of the calling task's team.
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_SYNCVAR_T
This flag specifies that the return value location,
.IR ret ,
points to a syncvar_t. This flag conflicts with other QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_* flags. If no QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_* flags are specified, the return value location is assumed to point to an aligned_t.
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_SINC
This flag specifies that the return value location,
.IR ret ,
points to a qt_sinc_t, and that the return value itself should be submitted to the sinc. This flag conflicts with other QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_* flags. If no QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_* flags are specified, the return value location is assumed to point to an aligned_t.
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_SINC_VOID
This flag specifies that the return value location,
.IR ret ,
points to a qt_sinc_t, and that the return value itself should be ignored. This flag conflicts with other QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_* flags. If no QTHREAD_SPAWN_RET_* flags are specified, the return value location is assumed to point to an aligned_t.
.TP
QTHREAD_SPAWN_PC_SYNCVAR_T
This flag specifies that the precondition array,
.IR preconds ,
is an array of pointers to syncvar_t's, rather than aligned_t's.

.SH SPAWN CACHE
Tasks are normally spawned into a thread-local cache of tasks. The contents of
this cache are not visible to other tasks until the next scheduling event, at
which point the cache is flushed into the local shepherd's globally visible
scheduling queue. Scheduling events are times when the scheduling queue must be
checked, namely, when the current task either blocks or yields. This cache can
be disabled at configure time, in which case, tasks are pushed into the
globally visible scheduling queue as they are spawned.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The operation of these functions is modified by the following environment
variables:
.TP 4
.B QTHREAD_STACK_SIZE
This variable specifies, in bytes, the size of the stacks that will be created for each
thread. Changes to this value during the course of the program run are ignored;
the value is only evaluated when
.BR qthread_initialize ()
is run.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the thread is spawned and 0 is returned. On error, a non-zero
error code is returned.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 12
.B ENOMEM
Not enough memory was available to spawn a task.
