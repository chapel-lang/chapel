Bug fixes:
 - corrected the behavior of qthread_readFF() and readFE() (they were
   dereferencing things too many times)
 - qthread_unlock() will now function correctly if unlocking something that's
   already unlocked (it could get into a deadlock situation before, because it
   wasn't cleaning up after itself)
 - fixed a typo in qalloc_dynmalloc() that could cause deadlock on some
   architectures
 - corrected memory pooling to eliminate assertion failures
