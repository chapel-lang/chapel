The qthreads library contains heavily modified parts of an earlier library
(libtask, by Russ Cox) that requires the propogation of its copyright
information. This sofware is in the fastcontext directory, namely the files:

	asm.S
	power-ucontext.h
	386-ucontext.h
	context.c
	taskimpl.h

However, as noted above, those files have been extensively modified, and do not resemble the original very much.

The rest of the qthread library, which will function on any Unix system with
the makecontext()-family of functions, can stand alone. Those files are simply
implementations of the makecontext() family of functions for performance.

The qthreads test and benchmark suite also contains some code from the
Unbalanced Tree Search benchmark; specifically their random number generator.
This code is entirely contained in the test/benchmarks/uts/rng directory and is
used only by the UTS implementation in test/benchmarks/uts. The license for the
random number generator code is in the LICENSE file in the
test/benchmarks/uts/rng directory.

The benchmark suite ALSO contains some code from the Sandia Mantevo project, contained in the test/benchmarks/mantevo directory. The licenses for those codes reside in their respective directories. For example, the HPCCG code license is in test/benchmarks/mantevo/hpccg/README.
