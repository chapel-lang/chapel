.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread/dictionary.h>

.I list_entry *
.br
.B qt_dictionary_iterator_next
.RI "(qt_dictionary_iterator *" iter );

.SH DESCRIPTION
This function advances the iterator and retrieves the next entry. The rules governing entry retrieval are the same as for
.BR qt_dictionary_iterator_get ().
.SH RETURN VALUES
Returns the entry that the iterator points to after advancing.
In racy concurrent situations, if the item indicated by the iterator was
deleted from the dictionary, multiple results may happen. The next element in
the dictionary may be returned, or NULL may be returned, OR an error may be
returned. However, it may not crash.
