.SH NAME
.B qt_team_parent_id
\- returns the current team's parent's unique ID number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread.h>

.I unsigned int
.br
.B qt_team_id 
(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns the unique identifier associated with the parent team of
the team to which the currently executing qthread belongs. Generally they are
monotonically increasing values, but the value can wrap around after
.BR UINT_MAX -1
teams. Only subteams have parent teams (or parent subteams). If this function
is called from a team without a parent, it will return
.B QTHREAD_NON_TEAM_ID.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the thread's parent team's identifying number is returned. If called from outside
the Qthreads library or from a parentless team,
.B QTHREAD_NON_TEAM_ID
is returned. The special value
.B QTHREAD_NULL_TEAM_ID
will never be returned.
