.SH NAME
.BR qtimer_start ", " qtimer_stop
\- start/stop a qtimer timing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread/qtimer.h>

.I void
.br
.B qtimer_start
.RI "(qtimer_t " timer );

.I void
.br
.B qtimer_stop
.RI "(qtimer_t " timer );
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions start and stop (respectively) the timing of the qtimer
.IR timer .
.PP
Before using these functions, the
.I timer
must have been initialized with
.BR qtimer_create ()
and must not have been destroyed with
.BR qtimer_destroy ().
.PP
In general, timers should not be started multiple times in a row without an
intervening stop, nor should they be stopped multiple times in a row without an
intervening start, though in most cases this will not cause an error, but will
just behave as a "last operation wins". Timers should also be started before
they are stopped, though in most cases this will not cause an error, but will
instead cause the value of
.BR qtimer_secs ()
to be undefined. However, the safety of mis-using qtimers is not guaranteed.
