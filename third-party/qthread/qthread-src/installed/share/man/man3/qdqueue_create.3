(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function initializes a qdqueue distributed queue object. This distributed
queue is locality aware, and as such prioritizes "nearby" data over the
globally oldest data. It provides an end-to-end ordering guarantee: elements
enqueued from any given location may not be consumed out of order by any other
single location.
