.SH DESCRIPTION
Initializes the futurelib environment so that threads may create
future computations.
.PP
The argument,
.IR vp_per_loc ,
specifies how many futures may be active on each location at a time. This does
not include qthreads which were not created as futures since futurelib is not
aware of how many of these exists. Active threads include all created futures
which are currently running and have not explicitly yielded. Inactive futures
are not limited, as this could easily lead to deadlock.
