2011-03-14 16:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  Also pushed the changes from Romain Dolbeau to improve hwloc
	  support.

2011-03-10 17:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  src/affinity/tile_affinity.c: remove unnecessary functions

2011-03-09 22:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/affinity/hwloc_affinity.c: alter the way worker threads bind
	  themselves to member-objects of shared resources to improve
	  performance. In other words, if more than one shepherd is sitting
	  within a shepherd boundary (e.g. a socket), their worker threads
	  will bind to different cores. (note: not the solution Allan and I
	  found, because that solution was broken)

2011-03-09 18:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/affinity/hwloc_affinity.c: more cache options, from Romain
	  Dolbeau

2011-03-08 19:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c, src/threadqueues.c: fix a stealing problem where

	  qthread_finalize()

2011-03-04 16:40  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/rose_xomp.c: omp_get_dynamic takes and returns a true value
	  of whether dynamic
	  thread counts are allowed -- not a specific number

2011-03-01 19:09  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/rose_xomp.c: fixes
	  allow multiple parallel loops within a single parallel region
	  clean up after loop (double barrier for now - should
	  be within barrier)
	  fix static scheduling -- allow late joins even after first
	  thread completes its allocation
	  

2011-02-28 22:33  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qloop.c, src/qthread.c,
	  src/rose_xomp.c: (qthread.h) add function declaration to allow a
	  thred making itself unstealable
	  (rose_xomp.c) set the original function as unstealable to allow
	  parallel
	  region cleanup
	  add code to track departed workers -- to figure out when loops
	  can be
	  cleaned up
	  (qthread.c) add function to set thread as unstealable
	  try again on parallel region cleanup
	  (qloop.c) add function to wait for completion and clean up linked
	  list of loops

2011-02-25 22:33  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: completely ignoring the return value is an
	  unacceptable solution to the problems that crop up when you don't
	  match the defined thread prototype

2011-02-25 22:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/syncvar.hpp: add assertion

2011-02-25 22:19  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/qthread.c: Rose generated fuctions have void return values.
	  Writing the return value to
	  a syncvar occasionally finds a negative value -- this causes
	  problems
	  change to write a 1 after the function completes

2011-02-25 15:51  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/qt_barrier.c, src/qthread.c: (qthread.c) remove debugging
	  (qt_barrier.c) fix uplocking -- don't try to overstep array on
	  way down
	  - It has never been emptied

2011-02-25 14:01  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/qt_barrier.c, src/qthread.c: Work on log barrier routine
	  (using syncvar_t under the covers)
	  turn off clean up in parallel region termination -- may have
	  active loops still
	  fix soon
	  (qthread.c) turn off clean up in parallel region termination
	  (qt_barrier.c)use smaller hammer (qthread_syncvar_writeEF instead
	  of
	  qthread_syncvar_fill) gives me better assurance that everything
	  is in
	  sync

2011-02-24 18:36  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/qt_barrier.c: fix some typos in switch to FEB's within log
	  barrier -- need better
	  testing strategy

2011-02-23 22:06  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* include/qloop_innards.h, include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qloop.c,
	  src/qthread.c, src/rose_xomp.c: work on nested loop termination
	  -- you can't delete the loop if anyone
	  may at sometime in the future look at it. Save until parellel
	  region
	  termination and then delete all outstanding loops (we know they
	  are done)
	  (qthread.h) add list of loops (generic to ease include problems)
	  (qloop_innards.h) give loops next ponter so we can build linked
	  lists
	  (rose_xomp.c) remove loop deleting in middle of loop_end
	  remove code to reuse loops
	  add call to qt_omp_parallel_region_destroy()
	  (qthread.c) add qt_omp_parallel_region_destroy to clean up
	  parallel region
	  link parallel regions so we can back up during deletin
	  (qloop.c) add hook to link loops together

2011-02-23 20:21  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/qt_barrier.c: change log barrier to use syncvars so that when
	  long stalls occur we can
	  leave barrier and do other work. This was not previously possible
	  before the
	  thread numbering was changed, since it possible for the same
	  hardware worker/
	  shepherd to hit a barrier more than once. With id's embedded in
	  the thread
	  this is not possible.

2011-02-22 22:38  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: avoid warning

2011-02-22 22:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/qt_barrier.h, include/qthread/qthread.h,
	  src/qthread.c: Really implement code to allow configuration
	  depended decision on the type of
	  barrier to use
	  (qt_barrier.h) Change call type to avoid multiple include
	  problems
	  (qthread.h) make barrier type #ifdef dependent
	  and return type of qt_thread_barrier call
	  (configure.in) add QTHREAD_LOG_BARRIER
	  (qthread.c) initialize the barrier the correct way depending on
	  type

2011-02-22 19:46  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/rose_xomp.c: Adding code to limit mallocs of loop structures
	  inside of loops --
	  reuse previous loop
	  start using QTHREAD_LOG_BARRIER to decide which barrier type to
	  use

2011-02-18 19:17  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* include/qloop_innards.h, src/qloop.c, src/rose_xomp.c:
	  (qloop_innards.h) add start so that static scheduling can use as
	  base
	  for iteration distribution
	  (rose_xomp.h) fix static iteration distribution (loop count
	  correct
	  off of correct base) -- may still need work for
	  negative increments
	  (qloop.c) initial start field

2011-02-17 20:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/Makefile.am: qt_affinity.h

2011-02-17 16:56  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/qthread.c, src/rose_xomp.c: minor fixes
	  
	  (rose_xomp.c) close race condition starting omp for loop
	  allow late thread to progress without executing any iterations
	  add double barrier so that we can clean up and release the loop
	  after the completion of all iterations
	  (qthread.c) set the barrier size in a parallel region to the
	  number
	  of workers (if MTS) rather than the number of shepherds

2011-02-17 15:19  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2011-02-15 19:47  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  avoid using it when possible inside the library (use
	  qthread_internal_self() when truly necessary)

2011-02-15 19:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  include/qt_shepherd_innards.h, include/qthread/qthread.h,
	  src/qthread.c, src/rose_log_arrivaldetector.c, src/rose_xomp.c:
	  Fix/complete rewrite of nested parallelism code -- now supports
	  two
	  flavors -- each OpenMP for loop surrounded by its own OpenMP
	  parallel
	  start(reasonably tested) -- and inner parallel loop is just an
	  iteration of the outer loop (not tested nearly as well)
	  
	  (qt_qthread_struct.h) add currunt parallel region pointer to the
	  extra
	  data structure of a thread
	  (qthread.h) add data structure for a parallel region -- contains
	  generic
	  loop pointer and barrier pointer for this region
	  thread flag values moved to include file
	  add 3 calls to create and access parallel region (calls in
	  rose_xopm.c)
	  (qt_arrive_first.h) nesting no longer needed as flag to
	  qt_global_arrive_first
	  (qt_shepherd_innards.h) add current parallel region to shepherd
	  struct
	  (rose_xomp.c) remove old nested code -- detection of nesting is
	  no longer
	  explicit and many static values not needed
	  new loop init code checks loop structure first pointed to by the
	  thread
	  and then in the argument to build independent loop structure
	  for each active loop
	  quided_loop_init rebuilt for the new nesting code and Rose
	  changing
	  to make top bound inclusive
	  (rose_log_arrivaldetector.c) simplify/remove nesting code
	  (qthread.c) add parallel region and remove staticly declared
	  barrier -- now
	  loop specific
	  mccoy thread empties is taskWaitLock on startup
	  thread flag values moved to include file
	  pack thread numbers across shepherds and then up cores
	  access functions for parallel region/barrier within it

2011-02-15 18:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qt_qthread_struct.h, src/qthread.c, src/threadqueues.c:
	  make threads unstealable, move thread flags into qthread_struct
	  header

2011-02-08 20:02  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/rose_xomp.c: (rose_xomp.c) completely rebuild the code to
	  execute ordered loops -- save
	  current loop execution in loop structure and check it before
	  allowing threads to leave the XOMP_ordered_start function

2011-02-07 20:03  Allan Porterfield <akp@renci.org>

	* src/threadqueues.c: (threadqueues.c) stealing
	  QTHREAD_STATE_SHEP_TERM thread make termination

2010-01-20 23:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2010-01-20 23:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qt_atomics.h, include/qthread_innards.h, src/qthread.c:
	  many changes getting it to work on tilera... not done yet. Using

	  possible (this is important on systems that incorrectly generate

2010-01-14 18:11  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: since the alignment of malloc is a finicky thing,

2010-01-14 17:00  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  reason

2010-01-14 16:57  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test3.c: even more verbosity, since this is such a basic
	  test

2010-01-14 16:52  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_makecontext.m4, configure.in,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/osx_compat/Makefile.am, test/Makefile.am:
	  rename OSX_MAKECONTEXT macros, because they are useful on non-OSX
	  platforms; also, use AC_CHECK_SIZEOF builtin autoconf macro

2010-01-14 16:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_assembly.m4: detect tilera assembly

2010-01-12 20:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: fixed up handling of

2009-12-15 17:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/qthread.c: support using sysctl() to detect the

2009-11-02 19:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/qthread_fork.3, man/man3/qthread_init.3: document

2009-10-30 19:45  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: the difference between input registers

2009-06-23 00:32  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_migrate.c: check that shepherds identify themselves

2009-06-23 00:29  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/osx_compat/asm.S: fix pthread_setspecific/getspecific; the

2009-06-23 00:00  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/Makefile.am, include/osx_compat,
	  include/osx_compat/386-ucontext.h,

	  include/osx_compat/taskimpl.h, src/osx_compat/386-ucontext.h,

	  include/qthread/qpool.h, include/qthread/qutil.h: omit extra
	  semicolons to quiet finicky compilers

2009-06-22 21:31  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_qdqueue.c, test/test_qlfqueue.c, test/test_qpool.c,
	  test/time_increments.c, test/time_qdqueue.c,

	* src/qdqueue.c, src/qlfqueue.c, src/qpool.c, src/qt_mpool.c,
	  src/qthread.c: stringent casting to make icc happy

2009-06-22 19:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qt_atomics.h: document logic for cas64

2009-06-22 19:22  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: fix qthread_cas64 on x86, use
	  xchg/xchg instead of pushl/popl to work around PIC issues
	  (faster, avoids using memory), and rework macros to remind me
	  that the PIC register has to be %4 to work with the macros
	  properly (that was the problem that broke qthread_cas64)

2009-06-16 19:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: handle errors in thread affinity

2009-06-16 19:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/wavefront.c: initialize all of wargs (quiet a compiler

2009-06-16 15:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: detect/handle more malloc failures

2009-06-16 04:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/wavefront.c: use a qpool for work units

2009-06-16 04:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/wavefront.c: this is a giant near-unconscionable hack, but it
	  prevents threads from spinning on workunits with missing prereqs.
	  essentially, each worker holds on to unusable work units until it
	  finds a usable one (or until there arent any left), and then
	  dumps any (previously) unusable ones back into the queue for
	  others to find

2009-06-16 03:39  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  happier

2009-06-15 20:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qlfqueue.c: no need to recalculate QPTR(next) in dequeue

	* src/wavefront.c: initialize R to avoid compiler warning

2009-06-14 05:51  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/wavefront.c: remove debugging lines, and fixes a minor
	  "access freed memory" ordering bug

2009-06-14 05:38  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/wavefront.h, src/wavefront.c,
	  test/test_wavefront.c: new (memory efficient) approach to
	  wavefront. being memory efficient means we can compute bigger
	  problems. bigger problems means more parallelism. Needs a way to
	  compute arbitrary [x,y] in the returned lattice (shouldnt be too
	  hard)

2009-06-14 05:35  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: no creating idiotic qarrays, even if asserts have
	  been turned off

	  test/time_increments.c, test/time_qarray.c,
	  test/time_qarray_sizes.c, test/time_wavefront.c: minor
	  signed-vs-unsigned comparison fixes

2009-06-11 17:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/Makefile.am, include/qt_gcd.h,

2009-06-11 16:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qutil.c: assuming that a cache line is a multiple of

	  the CHUNKSIZE intelligently

2009-06-11 04:23  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_wavefront.c: fix compiler warning

2009-06-11 04:01  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: PPC cacheline sizes, according to
	  http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn/tn2087.html - the G4
	  (always 32-bit) has 32-byte cache lines, while the G5 (always
	  64-bit) has 128-byte cache lines

2009-06-11 03:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_increments.c: correct the argument sizes (minor)

2009-06-11 03:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2009-06-11 03:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_cas.c: properly test CAS varieties

2009-06-11 03:09  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, test/Makefile.am: use the -restrict flag for icpc
	  (detecting this *should* be libtool's responsibility, IMHO)

2009-06-11 02:33  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_atomics.m4, include/qt_atomics.h,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h: properly detect systems that CAN do a
	  CAS-64 but whose compilers dont know how

2009-06-11 01:40  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_wavefront.c: always return a value

2009-06-10 22:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qt_atomics.h, include/qthread/qthread-sst.h,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: remove "portability"
	  bodge ("m"(*operand)) because PGI compiler miscompiles it (it
	  actually dereferences operand, rather than just taking the
	  address from operand); also fix a minor issue of redefining
	  QTHREAD_PIC_PREFIX

2009-06-10 21:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qlfqueue.c, src/qthread.c: cast arg2 of qthread_cas_ptr and
	  qt_cas to void* to remove the PGI warning

2009-06-10 21:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: correct the qthread_cas_ptr arg (the
	  memory pointed to by arg needs to be considered volatile... the
	  memory pointed to by the memory pointed to by arg is somewhat
	  besides the point).

2009-06-10 21:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/loop_iter.hpp: remove pointless const
	  declarations, and add PGI to the list of special-case compilers

2009-06-10 21:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qt_atomics.h: correct the qt_cas ptr (the memory pointed
	  to by ptr needs to be considered volatile... the memory pointed
	  to by the memory pointed to by ptr is somewhat besides the
	  point). Also a slight modification to cmpxchg syntax... might
	  make PGI compiler happy (maybe not)

2009-06-10 21:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qloop.c: PGI compiler has a cpp bug such that string appends
	  ignore subsequent whitespace. A workaround (used here) is to make
	  sure that when this is important, there is always a terminating
	  string. In other words, a declaration like "struct qt##initials
	  arg;" must become "struct qt##initials##_s arg;" or else PGI will
	  treat it as if it was "struct qt##initials##arg;

2009-06-10 20:55  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: more accurate requirement description on ia32
	  cmpxchg8b---makes PGI compiler happy. also avoid the noaffinity
	  label and goto (was kinda lame anyway)

2009-06-10 20:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: more accurate requirement description
	  on ia32 cmpxchg8b---makes PGI compiler happy

2009-06-09 21:39  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: fix incr/cas summary on some systems

2009-06-09 21:38  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_ia_cacheline.m4: icc without pic... should work,
	  but doesnt without this change (why?)

2009-06-09 21:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: use the correct register in 64-bit
	  IA32 CAS

2009-06-05 17:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  test/time_qdqueue_sizes.c, test/time_qlfqueue.c,
	  test/time_qpool.c: turns out, the "me" variable was being passed
	  around unnecessarily for a bunch of the initialization stuff

2009-05-09 03:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_allpairs.c: use new qarray iface

2009-05-09 03:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qarray.h, src/qarray.c, test/test_qarray.c,
	  test/time_qarray.c, test/time_qarray_sizes.c: fixing qarray
	  defaults; make the interface a little cleaner and more flexible

2009-05-09 03:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_gcd.c, test/time_qdqueue_sizes.c, test/time_qlfqueue.c,
	  test/time_qpool.c: fixing -Wall errors

2009-05-08 18:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/allpairs.h, src/allpairs.c, test/test_allpairs.c:
	  Made qt_allpairs work with qarrays instead of generic arrays
	  (input, not output). The idea is that this can be used to inform
	  locality decisions. The implementation is still relatively naive,
	  and VERY imbalanced, but it is at least parallel (heh).

2009-05-08 18:32  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qarray.h, src/qarray.c, test/test_qarray.c,
	  test/time_qarray.c, test/time_qarray_sizes.c: added a const
	  iter_loop, and made it possible to limit the range of iteration

2009-05-08 18:29  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fix -Wall warnings about unused things

2009-05-08 18:29  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: fix -Wall warnings

2009-05-08 18:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/futurelib.h, include/qthread/qdqueue.h,

	* test/test1.c: correct includes

2009-05-08 18:04  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: tidying up a little (mostly
	  whitespace, but added Q_STARTCXX and Q_ENDCXX to be helpful in
	  other headers)

2009-05-08 17:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qloop.h: tag static convenience functions as
	  unused, to avoid -Wall warnings

2009-05-08 17:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/common.h.in: make the attribute stuff available
	  to the header files

2009-05-08 17:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/qthread_check_attribute_aligned.m4,
	  config/qthread_check_attributes.m4: better filename

2009-05-08 17:51  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_attribute_aligned.m4, configure.in:
	  preparing to use gcc-style __attribute__ flags a bit more

2009-05-07 20:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/Makefile.am, include/qthread/allpairs.h,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/allpairs.c, test, test/Makefile.am,
	  test/test_allpairs.c: basic allpairs (needs much work - not
	  parallel!)

2009-05-07 19:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: try to guess the right number of threads if
	  qthread_init(0)

2009-05-07 19:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: fix lazy threadid dependence behavior

2009-04-14 18:47  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_libnuma.m4, src/qthread.c: detect and handle
	  old versions of libnuma

	* include/qthread/qthread-sst.h: sst versions of new functions

2009-04-14 15:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: cast qthread_incr argument... need a public cas to
	  make this correct, but this hack should be okay for now

2009-04-14 15:33  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: typo; fix number of args to free()

2009-04-10 23:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qpool.c: mutex pool

2009-04-03 19:00  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qpool.c: oop - typo

2009-04-03 18:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: initial support for
	  qthread_init(0)

2009-04-03 18:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: oh thank God, I merely got this test backwards. I
	  thought I was going *insane*

2009-04-03 17:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qarray_sizes.c: forgot to free the timer

2009-04-03 17:02  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2009-04-03 16:57  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qpool.c: time libnuma as well

2009-04-03 16:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qarray_sizes.c: use a limited set of sizes, and time
	  the assert1_loop ten times, just like everything else

2009-04-03 16:41  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qdqueue_sizes.c: qpool must be a ptr now

2009-04-03 16:40  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_qpool.c: qpool must be a ptr now

2009-04-03 16:38  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: STDC_HEADERS is an obsolete #def

2009-04-03 16:22  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: too many n's in onnode

	  consistent create/destroy semantic with the new data structures

2009-04-02 16:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: numa allocation apparently only does local memory if
	  you do it explicitly; but avoid using the wrong free() function

2009-04-02 15:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: explanatory comment

2009-04-01 06:19  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_builtin_expect.m4, include/Makefile.am,
	  include/qthread_expect.h: more portable handling of expect for
	  older autoconfs

2009-04-01 06:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/qthread_builtin_expect.m4, configure.in: lay
	  groundwork for using __builtin_expect()

2009-04-01 06:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qpool.h, src/qlfqueue.c, src/qpool.c: qpool is a

2009-03-31 17:42  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fix some NUMA typos in new shepherd distance stuff

2009-03-31 17:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: needs innards still, for NUMA

2009-03-31 17:30  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/qthread/qthread.h, man/man3/Makefile.am,

	  man/man3/qthread_sorted_sheps.3,
	  man/man3/qthread_sorted_sheps_remote.3, src/qthread.c: Created
	  public functions qthread_sorted_sheps and
	  qthread_sorted_sheps_remote, for use in data structures that want
	  to know how far apart shepherds are. Its a shortcut to getting a
	  list of remote shepherds in order from nearest to most distant.

2009-03-31 16:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: oop, too much (fix previous patch)

2009-03-31 16:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, man/man3/Makefile.am,

2009-03-31 15:32  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, man/man3/Makefile.am,

2009-03-30 18:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: fix affinity-only crash on Solaris

2009-03-30 18:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: avoid rounding issues on Solaris

2009-03-30 00:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qarray.h, src/qarray.c, test/test_qarray.c,
	  test/time_qarray.c, test/time_qarray_sizes.c: allow loop
	  iterations to have arguments

2009-03-29 22:26  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qarray.h: c++ externs <sigh>

2009-03-29 21:56  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: check for the math.h header even for SST

2009-03-29 21:55  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread-sst.h: avoid compiler warnings

2009-03-29 21:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/sst/futurelib-sst.c: future_fork_to

2009-03-29 21:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: avoid memset warning by including the right
	  headers

2009-03-29 21:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: make the CAS stuff portable (qthreads needs its
	  own CAS)

2009-03-28 07:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test, test/Makefile.am, test/time_qdqueue_sizes.c: pass around
	  memory blocks

2009-03-28 07:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qdqueue.c: skip the ordering test

2009-03-28 03:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test, test/Makefile.am, test/time_qdqueue.c: timing qdqueue

2009-03-28 03:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: formatting

2009-03-28 03:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2009-03-28 03:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: oops - left some libnuma dregs behind

2009-03-28 03:00  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/futurelib.c: calloc to avoid uninitialized variables (mostly
	  just for the bigass array); also, get rid of those pointless
	  MALLOC/FREE #defs

2009-03-28 02:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: initialize flags, and use calloc for stack (minor
	  safety precaution)

2009-03-28 02:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: memory is safer when initialized, and since we only
	  pay the cost once, its not a big deal

2009-03-28 02:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: first, numa allocation is way too slow (see
	  qpool.c log). second, memory is safer when initialized, and since
	  we only pay the cost once, its not a big deal

2009-03-28 02:48  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/ax_check_16aligned_malloc.m4, configure.in: check for
	  16-aligned calloc

2009-03-27 23:19  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: hypnotoad customization snuck in

2009-03-27 23:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: oops - debug printout

2009-03-27 23:00  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: fix numNeighbors bug in libnuma, make it work with
	  lgroup

2009-03-27 22:40  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c, src/qthread.c: fix lgrp setup (still needs
	  neighbor work)

2009-03-27 21:57  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: preliminary lgrp

2009-03-27 21:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: whitespace/reformatting

2009-03-27 21:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: fix behavior when all nodes are equidistant

2009-03-27 20:31  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qdqueue.c: compile on linux

2009-03-27 20:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qdqueue.h, src/Makefile.am, src/qdqueue.c, test,
	  test/Makefile.am, test/test_qdqueue.c: qdqueue implemented, ready
	  for testing

2009-03-25 18:35  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qarray.h, src/qarray.c, test/time_qarray.c: allow
	  forcing tight segments, so that the compiler can optimize tight
	  loops better

2009-03-23 19:35  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: add comment about TODO

2009-03-23 19:30  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: remove compiler warning

2009-03-23 19:29  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qlfqueue.c: compare to cp_list (not 100% fair
	  comparison, but makes me feel better)

2009-03-22 01:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qlfqueue.h, src/qlfqueue.c, test/test_qlfqueue.c,
	  test/time_qlfqueue.c: qlfqueue should use the user-accessible
	  qpool, not qt_mpool. To help, the interface now requires a *me*
	  argument

2009-03-22 01:03  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test, test/Makefile.am, test/test_qlfqueue.c,
	  test/time_qlfqueue.c: qlfqueue timer

2009-03-22 01:02  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: document potential wrongness in mpool

2009-03-20 20:47  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: using libnuma alloc routines is too slow, and
	  besides it should be automatically handled by the
	  numa_set_preferred() call

2009-03-20 20:46  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: a little minor simplification

2009-03-20 20:11  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: no affinity means normal allocation (libnuma is too
	  wasteful)

2009-03-20 20:09  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fix the NUMA node-choice math

2009-03-20 19:41  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qpool.c: rearrange tests

2009-03-20 19:41  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_qpool.c: minor thing...

2009-03-20 19:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: single-threaded shepherds dont need the lock

2009-03-20 17:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qpool.h, src/qpool.c, test/test_qpool.c,
	  test/time_qpool.c: Make qpool distributed.

2009-03-20 17:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread_asserts.h: minor assert bug

2009-03-20 15:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qpool.c: there we go...

2009-03-20 15:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: folding

2009-03-20 14:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qpool.c: that bug was *obvious*

2009-03-20 14:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/Makefile.am, include/qthread/qpool.h,
	  src/Makefile.am, src/qpool.c, test, test/Makefile.am,
	  test/test_qpool.c, test/time_qpool.c: make qpool available...
	  need to figure out the bug in it

2009-03-19 16:59  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread_innards.h, src/qarray.c: fix the
	  qthread_internal_shep_to_node checks to handle shepherds with no
	  affinity correctly; add an official "name" for the "no affinity"
	  result

2009-03-19 16:57  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_altix_timer.m4: this should have been
	  AC_RUN_IFELSE, because apparently some distributions of Linux
	  LOOK like they have an altix timer, when in fact attempting to
	  use it causes a segfault

2009-03-18 14:04  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qlfqueue.c: fix qlfqueue_empty return code on null queues

2009-03-18 14:03  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: 1.2 bump

2009-03-17 20:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/futurelib.h, src/futurelib.c, src/qloop.c: safer
	  futurelib forking. added future_fork_to (a mirror of
	  qthread_fork_to), and stopped qloop.c from using
	  qthread_fork_future_to() directly (because that bypassed futures
	  bookkeeping)

2009-03-17 20:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qloop.c: don't assume that futurelib has been initialized

2009-03-17 17:22  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: handle 64-bit aligned_t properly on IA32 (stole
	  code from qthread.h)

2009-02-27 00:01  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: oops... "node" is used even without libnuma

2009-02-26 22:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: whitespace

2009-02-26 22:51  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qarray.c: use libnuma to ensure that memory really IS local

2009-02-18 21:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/qthread.c: make the pthread-cond-wait thing

	  far

2009-02-13 04:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_qarray_sizes.c: memset/memcmp turns out to be faster.

2009-02-12 16:32  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: this seems to fix a race condition on Sparc (not

2009-02-05 21:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  ought to be tailored to the specific machine in the future

2009-02-05 21:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_qarray.c: eliminate compiler warnings doing pointer
	  arithmetic on void* by converting to char*

2009-02-04 00:00  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_producerconsumer.c: move increment tests to
	  time_increments

2009-01-30 17:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: why is this not __volatile__?

2009-01-29 19:56  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/ax_check_16aligned_malloc.m4, configure.in,

	  malloc

2009-01-29 19:56  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_gcd.c: oops, forgot the C file

2009-01-29 00:04  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: use valloc as a last resort for aligned

2008-12-17 19:09  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test2.c, test/test3.c: corrected the fprintf arguments

2008-12-17 18:26  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/qthread_check_atomics.m4, configure.in,
	  include/qthread/common.h.in, include/qthread/qthread.h: some
	  compilers support builtin atomic operations

2008-12-12 22:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_id.c: make the id test more resilient to configure
	  options (specifically, --enable-debug)

2008-12-12 21:42  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: more early clobbering on ppc (good
	  thing we have plenty of registers!)

2008-12-12 21:30  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: the ppc64 mod code is now tested; removed warning

2008-12-12 21:18  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config: more autoconf droppings

2008-12-12 08:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.hpp: get rid of some -Wall warnings

2008-12-12 08:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread_innards.h, src/futurelib.c, src/qthread.c: move

2008-12-12 07:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/osx_compat/asm.S: good reference comments

2008-12-12 06:58  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: use va_arg macro in debugging

2008-12-11 20:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/osx_compat/asm.S: ignore segment registers... seems to cause
	  problems on x86_64, despite their regular use on IA32, and
	  besides, I don't think we have to callee-save them *anyway*

2008-12-11 20:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/osx_compat/asm.S, src/osx_compat/context.c,

	* include/qthread/Makefile.am, include/qthread/qthread.h,
	  include/qthread/qthread.hpp: * Add C++ "bindings" for the FEBs.
	  Just a template wrapper so that we can
	  accept any pointer type that has an underlying type that is the
	  same size
	  as aligned_t. Also allows qthread_incr() to be called for all
	  supported
	  types, rather than having fincr() and dincr().

2008-12-06 21:34  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.hpp: checkpoint to switch machines. First
	  take at the shell of a c++ wrapper to
	  the qthreads api

2008-12-05 08:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/Makefile.am: oops

2008-12-05 04:39  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/Makefile.am: aligned_t requires a compatibility bump

2008-12-04 22:53  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/qthread_empty.3, man/man3/qthread_feb_status.3,

2008-12-04 22:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread-sst.h, include/qthread/qthread.h,

2008-12-04 22:01  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread-sst.h, include/qthread/qthread.h,

2008-12-04 21:58  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qloop.h, include/qthread/qthread-sst.h,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c, src/qutil.c:
	  qthread_readFF requires aligned_t arguments

2008-12-04 21:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qutil.h: qutil now works on aligned_t types
	  rather than ints and uints

2008-12-04 21:47  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread-sst.h, include/qthread/qthread.h,

2008-12-04 21:25  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: Fix race condition in the mpool. The variable
	  syncmode was being used both
	  to initialize cprops hash table and the mpool. Unfortunately, the
	  default
	  for multi-threaded codes, COLLECTION_MODE_PLAIN, is 0, which was
	  disabling
	  synchronization in the mpool. Split the meanings to be more
	  obvious.

2008-12-04 19:57  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: sigh

2008-12-04 18:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2008-12-04 18:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: typo in the last commit :P

2008-12-04 17:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/qthread/common.h.in,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: clarity in the
	  aligned_t size/alignment logic... I think

2008-12-04 17:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: better 64-bit handling on 32-bit
	  sparc, plus minor cleanup to make inlining easier

2008-12-03 23:56  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am: upon suggestion of libtoolize...

2008-12-03 19:04  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/qthread/common.h.in,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: Change default on 64
	  bit platforms to be an align_t that is 64 bits long and
	  64 bits aligned. At the same time, make it a little bit more
	  clear what
	  size things are with the #defines

2008-12-03 18:52  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: add magic to allow qthread_incr to
	  support both 32 and 64 bit math

2008-12-02 22:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/qthread.c: lower-overhead debugging with a
	  handwritten debug printf (no longer requires fullsize stacks)

2008-12-02 22:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test_id.c: in debug mode, more threads get ids

2008-12-02 20:58  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/qthread.c: allow runtime debug-level control
	  via QTHREAD_DEBUG_LEVEL envariable

2008-11-25 19:33  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: shepherd profiling needs to not skip shepherd 0

2008-11-25 03:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/benchmark.c, test/test1.c, test/test2.c, test/test3.c,
	  test/testdincr.c, test/testqloop.c, test/time_increments.c,
	  test/time_producerconsumer.c: sometimes the test harness feeds us
	  garbage arguments... so be tolerant of nonsensical numbers of
	  threads

2008-11-25 03:15  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: use some more generic notation on the
	  sparc ... suspect that dincr wont work on sparc 32 bits because
	  the registers arent big enough

2008-11-25 00:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fix the asserts to be correct with the new
	  single-threaded shepherd 0

2008-11-24 19:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qt_mpool.c: sanity asserts

2008-11-24 19:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/Makefile.am, include/qthread/qthread-sst.h,

2008-11-24 04:22  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: rearrange a little for sanity's sake, and also add

	  debugging/profiling purposes

2008-11-24 04:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/future_join_all.3: fix description, update to current

	  beginning support for the QINLINE keyword

2008-11-07 23:26  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/Makefile.am: oop; missed this in the last commit

2008-11-07 23:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/Makefile.am, include/qtimer.h,
	  src/qthread.c, src/qtimer/Makefile.am, src/qtimer/qtimer.h:
	  reorganizing a little

2008-11-07 23:04  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/Makefile.am, include/qt_mpool.h, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/qt_mpool.c, src/qthread.c: qt_mpool replaces cp_mempool;
	  simpler, and less finicky

2008-11-07 22:23  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: avoid register re-use in qthread_fincr

2008-11-07 20:23  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2008-11-07 20:11  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: reversing the
	  return-value of qthread_incr

2008-10-09 21:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: slightly cleaner version of the previous fix

2008-10-09 21:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fixed on MAKECONTEXT_SPLIT systems, I think

2008-10-08 15:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qloop.c: avoid unnecessary malloc call if shepherd_count is 1

2008-09-29 22:11  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_producerconsumer.c: another timer loop, just to see if
	  theres a difference

2008-09-29 22:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: without pthreads as a config option, with
	  appropriate warnings

2008-09-29 22:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: basic non-pthreads support... but REALLY basic
	  (still uses mutexes for most stuff)

2008-09-25 17:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_makecontext.m4,
	  src/osx_compat/386-ucontext.h, src/osx_compat/asm.S,
	  src/osx_compat/context.c, src/osx_compat/power-ucontext.h,

	  http://github.com/stevedekorte/io/tree/f8b0893a8317cbefd5cffe1cebe591ad6c12ae89/libs/coroutine/source

2008-09-25 17:04  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: since OSX 10.5.x has non-functional swapcontext
	  functions, we have to test whether swapcontext works before
	  deciding whether we need to use the compatability library

2008-09-25 16:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread_innards.h: remove an assert warning on osx 10.5

2008-09-23 18:19  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: optimize serial execution a little by avoiding

	* test/Makefile.am, test/test1.c, test/test2.c, test/test_id.c,
	  test/testdincr.c, test/testincr.c, test/testloop.cpp: remove

	  (qthread_self() never returns NULL!!!)

2008-09-19 01:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: qthreads can now run in SERIAL... removing the
	  pthread requirement comes next?

2008-09-09 21:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/qthread_stackleft.3: fix copy/paste error

2008-09-01 19:57  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2008-08-18 22:04  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_increments.c: stupid OoO confusion

2008-08-18 21:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2008-08-12 22:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_producerconsumer.c, test/time_swap.c: convenient
	  formatting, added parallel producer/consumer loops

2008-08-12 22:05  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: remind me of how it *should* be

2008-08-12 17:58  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: gcc on sparc is being idiotic and
	  buggy - work around it and leave a comment about whats going on

2008-08-12 15:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/time_producerconsumer.c: sanity checking

2008-08-12 05:52  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/Makefile.am: oops, delete CONTEXTLIB from time_swap
	  dependencies

2008-08-12 05:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: disabled QTHREAD_WAIT_TIMER_STOP needss second
	  argument

	* src/qthread.c: whitespace fixes according to GNU indent

2008-08-11 23:47  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: lock profiling, slightly improved shepherd
	  profiling, and some small syntactic sugar improvements fro thread
	  counting

2008-08-11 23:35  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am: test comes last, for sanity reasons. sadly, this
	  means the installation info is printed earlier, but ce est la vie

2008-08-11 23:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/futurelib.c: minor speed improvement for futurelibs
	  destination decision; based on qthread core

2008-08-08 20:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, test/Makefile.am, test/time_producerconsumer.c,
	  test/time_swap.c: time_swap to time the length of swapcontext and
	  time_producerconsumer to time lots of other things that qthreads
	  can do; use --enable-timer-progs to turn them on

2008-07-30 16:38  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qloop.c: fixed memory leaks

2008-07-29 19:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: avoid manipulating CFLAGS directly

2008-07-29 19:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: fold fincr

2008-07-24 16:18  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: oops; left the stdio.h in there

2008-07-21 16:51  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/Makefile.am, man/man3/qthread_dincr.3,
	  man/man3/qthread_fincr.3, man/man3/qthread_incr.3: document the
	  new increment functions

2008-07-21 16:40  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: comment typo

2008-07-18 22:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test:

2008-07-18 22:51  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/testfincr.c: a little better debugging info if things go
	  wrong

2008-07-18 22:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: correcting some weird register re-use
	  issues on ppc with fincr... rearranging inputs and outputs to try
	  and make things sane again

2008-07-18 18:18  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: minor change

2008-07-18 15:56  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: asm64 should work form ia32 in fincr

2008-07-18 15:55  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: better fincr comments on amd64

2008-07-18 15:50  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: minor fincr logic error on amd64

2008-07-18 15:42  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: amd64 fincr

2008-07-18 15:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: ia64 typo in fincr

2008-07-18 15:35  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: ia64 fincr

2008-07-18 15:29  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: fix sparc typos in fincr

2008-07-18 15:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, test/Makefile.am, test/testfincr.c:
	  adding qthread_fincr()

2008-07-01 20:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/Makefile.am, man/man3/qthread_dincr.3: document
	  qthread_dincr

2008-06-30 22:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* README: help with SST

2008-06-16 18:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: support IA32 PIC code (e.g. MacOS X
	  generates PIC code by default)

2008-06-16 16:32  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: added AMD64-specific code, and rewrote
	  the IA32 code so that it works on an Athlon, with lots of
	  explanatory commenting. As a useful side-effect, the IA32 code is
	  now much more elegant (and I understand gcc inlined ASM semantics
	  more than I did before)

2008-06-13 21:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test: ignore testdincr binary

2008-06-13 21:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: fix the typo for IA64 and get it
	  working with punned types

2008-06-13 20:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: minor typo in SPARC type punning

2008-06-13 18:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: IA32 (and maybe AMD64) assembly for
	  dincr rewritten and tested

2008-06-13 18:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qutil.c: qutil function args should be declared const

2008-06-13 18:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: make configure work properly even when echo doesnt
	  support the -n flag

2008-06-13 18:23  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qutil.h: qutil function args should be declared
	  const

2008-06-12 20:49  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: PPC32 now compiles cleanly despite
	  lack of dincr support

2008-06-12 20:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/Makefile.am, test/testdincr.c: test the qthread_dincr
	  function

2008-06-12 20:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: qthread_dincr works on PPC64 now...
	  testing type punning (read: unions)

2008-06-12 20:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_makecontext.m4, src/osx_compat/asm.S: 64-bit
	  PPC OSX makecontext support!

2008-06-12 16:46  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test2.c: make error assertion a little more useful

2008-06-12 16:45  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fix the 64-bit test in the incr_mod function on
	  ia64

2008-06-12 16:42  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: add qthread_dincr

2008-05-05 23:25  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: remove spurious error when enabling debug trace

2008-05-05 23:23  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test1.c: fix the test (why does this matter?)

2008-04-11 22:02  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: better error handling (less reliance on assert)

2008-04-04 22:01  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qtimer/gethrtime.c, src/qtimer/mach.c: ifdef the config.h so
	  I can use this code for other stuff

2008-04-04 21:57  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, test/Makefile.am: this should help build the src
	  before the test when doing `make check` -- as long as
	  check_SUBDIRS is supported by automake (otherwise its just as bad
	  as before)

2008-04-04 21:46  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: be more verbose about qtimer type

2008-04-04 21:46  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qtimer/altix.c: MMTIMER_GETFREQ returns results in Hz, not
	  micro-Hz

2008-04-04 21:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qtimer/gettimeofday.c: ifdef the config.h so I can use this
	  code for other stuff

2008-04-02 18:45  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qutil.c: fix the sizeof assertion

2008-03-28 18:37  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/qutil_double_max.3, man/man3/qutil_double_min.3,
	  man/man3/qutil_double_mult.3, man/man3/qutil_double_sum.3: minor
	  documentation change

2008-03-28 18:33  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* man/man3/qutil_double_max.3, man/man3/qutil_double_min.3,
	  man/man3/qutil_double_mult.3, man/man3/qutil_double_sum.3,
	  src/qutil.c, test/test1.c: if sizeof(int) < sizeof(aligned_t),
	  avoid errors by aborting - DOCUMENT THIS

2008-03-24 17:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: another AS_IF fix

2008-03-24 17:31  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: AS_IF doesnt quite work as advertized on autoconf
	  2.59

2008-03-22 15:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_sst.m4, configure.in: trying to avoid excess
	  flags

2008-03-21 18:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_sst.m4: typo

2008-03-21 18:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/sst/qthread-sst.c: fix the qthread_fork_to retval

2008-03-19 04:46  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: fix a bunch of casts for SST (which
	  corrects some compiler errors) and fix a problem with
	  qthread_incr() returning the wrong value

2008-03-19 04:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread_innards.h, src/qloop.c: on SST, we have no qlib
	  object, so we need a new way of finding out how many shepherds
	  there are

2008-03-19 04:43  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_sst.m4, src/Makefile.am: a bunch of compiler
	  flags are needed to compile a valid library for use with the SST

2008-03-14 19:38  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h, src/qthread.c: fixed the WORDSIZE bug
	  by replacing it with sizeof(aligned_t). also moved a few things
	  around in qthread.h to make it a little tidier, and increased the
	  size of qthread_shepherd_id_t (cuz these days you just never
	  know)

2008-03-14 19:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: theres no reason UINT8_MAX should need to be
	  defined in the code (if the system is wonky, define it in the
	  configure script)

2008-03-14 19:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: not sure what system this was supposed to fix, but
	  whatever it was, the test should go into the configure script
	  instead of the code

2008-03-14 19:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/qthread.c: moved default stack size
	  determination into the configure script, and out of the code

2008-03-14 18:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: rolled back the AS_CASE constructions. Apparently
	  "too immature to be widely used" means "AS_CASE is not supported
	  by autoconf 2.59"

2008-03-14 00:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: fixed --enable-asserts (missing a comma),
	  simplified a few AS_IF instances, and replaced the two case
	  statements with AS_CASE constructions. The documentation for
	  autoconf says the AS_IF and AS_CASE constructions are "too
	  immature to be widely used"... Oh well.

2008-03-14 00:19  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: should really check these things

2008-03-13 23:47  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: 64-bit incr_mod implementation

2008-03-13 23:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: tidy up the new asm changes a little

2008-03-13 22:00  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: Also need to set alignment to 64 bit when using 64
	  bit align_t

2008-03-13 21:52  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/qthread/common.h.in,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h: Differentiate between alignment and
	  size for align_t type

2008-03-13 21:44  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/qthread_check_assembly.m4, configure.in,
	  include/qthread/common.h.in, include/qthread/qthread.h,
	  src/qthread.c: * Test to see if compiler can properly do gcc
	  inline assembly
	  * Fix IA-32 increment when optimizer enabled
	  * Add better support for platforms that can have aligned_t be
	  either
	  32 or 64 bits

2008-03-11 20:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: intel OSX boxes

2008-03-03 22:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* autogen.sh: enough of cross-compiling warnings

2008-03-03 19:31  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/Makefile.am: dependencies

2008-03-03 19:30  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: simpler need-qtimer test

2008-03-03 19:30  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qtimer/Makefile.am, src/qtimer/altix.c: altix qtimer fixes

2008-03-01 19:04  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/qthread_check_altix_timer.m4, configure.in,
	  src/qtimer/altix.c: Add initial (untested) support for Altix
	  timers

2008-02-29 01:55  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog: svn2cl stuff

2008-02-29 01:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/test1.c, test/testloop.cpp: silence garbage test output

2008-02-29 01:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qtimer/Makefile.am: fix error compiling without need of
	  qtimer

2008-02-29 01:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: correct incr when using mutexes

2008-02-29 01:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test/testqloop.c: silce the output

2008-02-29 01:11  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/Makefile.am: qloop goes with sst too

2008-02-29 01:11  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/qthread.h: correct incr for Altix

2008-02-29 00:51  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: use AS_IF

2008-02-29 00:46  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am: fix qtimer inclusion

2008-02-29 00:28  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: remove format warning on icc

2008-02-29 00:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c: fix writeF return value

2008-02-29 00:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* ., include/qthread: better ignores

2008-02-29 00:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4: use dnl

2008-02-29 00:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* src/qthread.c, test/test_id.c: now we're down to just two
	  assembly loops

2008-02-28 21:36  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* config/qthread_check_attribute_aligned.m4,
	  include/qthread/qthread.h: Hack for working around Sun's
	  attribute aligned issue -- I can't seem to
	  find a way to make a small testcase that shows the problem. Ugh.

2008-02-28 21:08  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* src/osx_compat/context.c: Fix compiler warning

2008-02-28 20:57  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, src/qtimer/gethrtime.c, src/qtimer/gettimeofday.c:
	  - Find the right timer
	  - Fix missing header in gettimeofday timer
	  - Implement Solaris gethrtime timer

2008-02-28 20:20  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: Verified we could use AM 1.7. Added rational for
	  not supporting 1.6.3
	  (which is what ships with Tiger)

2008-02-28 20:08  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, config/ac_use_system_extensions.m4: Fix
	  compatibility with AC 2.52

2008-02-28 19:58  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* ., Makefile.am, acinclude.m4,
	  config/qthread_check_attribute_aligned.m4,
	  config/qthread_check_makecontext.m4, config/qthread_check_sst.m4,
	  configure.in, include/Makefile.am, include/qthread/Makefile.am,
	  man/Makefile.am, man/man3/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am,
	  src/osx_compat/Makefile.am, src/qalloc.c, src/qloop.c,
	  src/qthread.c, src/qtimer/Makefile.am, src/qtimer/gethrtime.c,
	  src/qtimer/gettimeofday.c, src/qtimer/mach.c, test/Makefile.am:
	  Rather large rewrite of configure and build files to be a little
	  bit
	  more user friendly and fix up a couple of issues that were
	  causing
	  problems on some platforms. Also splits the big macros into their
	  own .m4 files to make the top-level configure a bit easier to
	  follow.

2008-02-27 23:36  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Remove turd files during make clean.
	  Don't need to be quite as aggressive
	  as before, as we don't need quite as pristine a source tree now
	  that
	  "make dist" is used instead of tarring up the source...

2008-02-27 23:31  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: Ugly hack to pass in --with-cprops to
	  configure during distcheck if it was
	  passed to the initial configure, so that make distcheck will work
	  if
	  cprops isn't in the default search path.

2008-02-27 23:26  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* config/ac_compile_check_sizeof.m4: Fix typo in their macro (which
	  Kyle had fixed in the old acinclude version)

2008-02-27 23:17  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, config,
	  config/ac_compile_check_sizeof.m4, config/ac_prog_cc_c99.m4,
	  config/ax_create_stdint_h.m4, configure.in: Clean up macro usage

2008-02-27 22:51  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* COPYING, COPYRIGHT, Makefile.am, configure.in: Small AC/AM
	  cleanups

2008-02-27 22:50  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* include/qthread/Makefile.am: Ooops, actually do need to distclean
	  qthread-int.h

2008-02-27 22:35  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in, include/qthread, include/qthread/Makefile.am,
	  include/qthread/common.h.in: Use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS instead of own
	  command to generate common.h

2008-02-27 22:09  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* ., config, configure.in: move build artifacts into subdirectory

2008-02-27 22:04  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: Learn to spell

2008-02-27 22:04  Brian Barrett <bwbarre@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: Add --with-cprops option to avoid having to set
	  CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS...

2008-02-26 22:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, include, include/Makefile.am, man,
	  man/Makefile.am: autoupdate on grover brings the code up to spec
	  for autotools 2.59... apparently it doesnt like it when subdirs
	  are subdirs

2008-02-26 22:08  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure.in: AS_HELP_STRING is standard in 2.59, I believe

2008-02-26 22:02  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4: source comment

2008-02-26 21:31  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, include/futurelib_innards.h,
	  include/qthread/Makefile.am, include/qthread_innards.h,
	  man/man3/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/futurelib_innards.h,
	  src/qthread_innards.h, test/Makefile.am: rearranged and updated

2007-04-12 17:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test.c: the testcase can be smaller

	  before

2007-03-23 22:40  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: no need for the addrstat2 structure anymore

2007-03-23 22:40  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure, configure.in: typo

2007-03-23 20:48  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* futurelib.c: no locks needed in blocking_vp_incr when running on
	  an SMP

2007-03-10 00:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: note binary incompatibility

2007-03-10 00:10  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* futurelib.c, qthread.c: Extensive use of pthread_getspecific()
	  and related thread-local memory pieces.
	  In theory, this allows us to be a bit faster on very large
	  systems with
	  intelligently implemented pthreads libraries (in practice on
	  smaller systems,
	  it doesn't hurt). Also removed a bunch of locks from thread
	  spawning, namely
	  deciding which shepherd to send it to and generating a thread ID.
	  Now (unless
	  QTHREAD_NONLAZY_THREADIDS is defined) thread ID's are only
	  generated if you
	  ASK for them (via qthread_id()), and which shepherd to send a
	  thread to is
	  done via a per-shepherd round-robin (thus, no locks). This
	  shouldn't result in
	  imbalanced code for sufficiently large numbers of threads.

2007-03-10 00:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread/loop_templates.hpp: formatting

2007-03-07 23:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  for FEBs, but havent yet)

2007-02-28 18:24  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: better assert handling

2007-02-27 19:39  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* futurelib.c: PGI wants this to be cast

2006-11-29 18:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* testloop.cpp: Attempting to solve an intractable problem. The
	  deal is that we want to make
	  this template only accept array-ish types (i.e. objects that have
	  operator[]
	  defined), but have no real way of doing that in a cross-compiler
	  compatable
	  way. Suggestions are very welcome.

2006-11-29 00:02  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread/loop_templates.hpp: when installed, it needs to be able

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: created the prepare() and run() functions
	  for Megan

2006-11-16 17:59  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure,

	  never unlock it)

2006-11-15 22:54  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: speeding up all the locks

2006-11-13 19:03  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* README: PGI comments

2006-11-07 17:48  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: more memory efficiency for delayed joins (does this
	  actually affect many things? I doubt it, but you never know, and
	  it doesnt hurt anything)

2006-11-07 17:41  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: fix pgCC compile errors (one warning remains, because
	  C++ structs are really classes)

2006-11-07 00:03  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in: this api is definitely binary
	  incompatible with the previous

2006-11-07 00:02  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: made many things const, to help with optimization.
	  also changed the locking "sub" helpers to be detached (as they

	  to the .h file

2006-11-06 22:55  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: added the ability to proxy FEB locking

2006-11-06 22:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, config.h.in, configure, configure.in,
	  qthread.c, qthread.h, test3.c: 64-bit safe, works with new FEB
	  locking semantics

2006-11-06 18:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test.c, test3.c: because qthread_lock and _unlock now function,
	  now I can use qthread_join() directly, and avoid nonsense that I
	  had previously had to go through to wait for things to finish.

2006-11-06 18:34  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: qthread_lock and _unlock now will function
	  correctly if passed a NULL thread

2006-11-06 17:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* configure, configure.in: correct cprops url

2006-11-06 17:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, config.h.in, configure:
	  updates from the new acinclude and configure.in

2006-11-06 17:09  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* acinclude.m4, configure.in: need stdint... would like to have
	  inttypes, but...

2006-11-06 17:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: fixed struct rlimit on non-gcc compilers

2006-11-06 17:06  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	  made it usable by C++ applications

2006-11-06 16:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.h: better descriptions

2006-11-06 16:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: pooling is fixed again. realized that addrres's were
	  being fed to other thread's pools, which will obviously cause
	  problems in unsynch'd pools. However, what this does is puts
	  memory back in a pool that it did not come from. This *shouldn't*
	  be a problem, because the size is right, but I mention it because
	  you never know.

2006-11-04 00:07  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: spacing

2006-11-04 00:03  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: pooling is broken again... not sure why. trimmed the
	  critical section in FEB table removal (unnecessary, but then, why
	  not?)

2006-11-03 22:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: dont have private int file yet

2006-11-03 22:16  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.h: correct semantics

2006-11-03 22:15  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.h: play nicely with C++

2006-11-03 22:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: comments, many compilation fixes for non-gcc compilers
	  (not all finished), and some semantic fixes for the readFE/readFF
	  functions

2006-11-03 19:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: explain double-casting

2006-11-03 19:21  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* test2.c: none of that memwatch stuff

2006-11-03 17:20  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qalloc.c: better compatability and warning messages

2006-11-01 00:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* 386-ucontext.h, COPYRIGHT, Makefile.am, Makefile.in, aclocal.m4,
	  asm.S, config.h.in, configure, configure.in, context.c,
	  mkinstalldirs, power-ucontext.h, taskimpl.h: it now works on OSX
	  as well as linux and solaris -- pulled in parts from libtask (by
	  Russ Cox)

2006-11-01 00:12  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: works with the portable makecontext stuff, also
	  cleaned up the code some

2006-10-31 19:40  Richard Murphy <rcmurph@sandia.gov>

	* AUTHORS: updated names/affiliations

2006-10-31 17:36  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: no, on some architectures (dunno which ones) this
	  getcontext is required (it is used by most other similar
	  coroutine libraries)

2006-10-31 17:35  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* README: accuracy and completeness

2006-10-31 17:27  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* testq.c: dynmap

2006-10-30 20:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: per-pthread memory pooling eliminates a bunch of
	  unnecessary locking (some still needed)

2006-10-30 18:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c: pooling stacks and contexts now. also assigning
	  shepherd ID much earlier (preparing for per-shepherd pools)

2006-10-26 17:44  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c, test2.c: the pooling seems a bit better now...

2006-10-26 14:17  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

2006-10-26 14:14  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* qthread.c, qthread.h: Added detached threads (i.e. threads that
	  clean up after themselves when they
	  exit), and made it possible to toggle mempooling on and off
	  (currently,

	  architectures).

	* qthread.c: minor touches

2006-10-18 21:13  Kyle Wheeler <kbwheel@sandia.gov>

	* COPYING, INSTALL, config.guess, config.sub, depcomp, install-sh,
	  ltmain.sh, missing: all the automake files
