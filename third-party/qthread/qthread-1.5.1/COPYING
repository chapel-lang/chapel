The qthreads library contains parts of an earlier library (libtask, by Russ
Cox) that requires the propogation of its copyright information. This sofware
is in the osx_compat directory, namely the files:

	asm.S
	power-ucontext.h
	386-ucontext.h
	context.c
	taskimpl.h

The rest of the qthread library, which will function on any Unix system with
the makecontext()-family of functions, can stand alone. Those files are simply
implementations of the makecontext() family of functions for MacOS X, which
doesn't have them (as of OSX 10.4).
