.TH qthread_id 3 "NOVEMBER 2006" libqthread "libqthread"
.SH NAME
.B qthread_id
\- returns the qthread's unique ID number
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread.h>

.I unsigned int
.br
.B qthread_id
.RI "(qthread_t *" me );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function returns the unique identifier associated with the qthread
.IR me .
This is used mostly for debugging, as the qthread_t pointer itself is a valid
temporally-unique identifier (the qthread_t structures can be re-used). Unless
otherwise configured, the qthread library assigns thread ids only when they are
asked for. Generally they are monotonically increasing values, but the value
can wrap around after
.B UINT_MAX
threads.
.SH RETURN VALUE
On success, the thread's identifying number is returned.
