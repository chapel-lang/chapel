.TH qthread_yield 3 "NOVEMBER 2006" libqthread "libqthread"
.SH NAME
.B qthread_yield
\- release the CPU, allow other qthreads to run
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread.h>

.I void
.br
.B qthread_yield
.RI "(qthread_t *" me );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function allows a qthread to explicitly interrupt computation and give
other qthreads the chance to execute even though it has not blocked. This can
be useful for things like busy-waits or cooperative multitasking. Without using
this function, there is no guarantee that other qthreads will have a chance to
execute until the currently running qthread performs a synchronization
operation.
.PP
The argument,
.IR me ,
should be a pointer to the qthread_t structure for the currently running
qthread, or NULL. If
.I me
is NULL, the qthread_t pointer will be looked up via
.BR qthread_self ().
If this function is called from a non-qthread or before the
.BR qthread_initialize ()
has been run, it does nothing.
