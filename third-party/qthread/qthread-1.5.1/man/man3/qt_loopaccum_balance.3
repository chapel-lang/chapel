.SH DESCRIPTION
This function provides a simple C implementation of a threaded accumulating
loop. Rather than using a predictable number of threads, however, the number of
threads generated depends directly upon the number of shepherds available. The
difference between
.BR qt_loopaccum_balance ()
and
.BR qt_loopaccum_balance_future ()
is that the former uses qthreads and the latter uses futures. The idea with the
accumulation is that they can be used to collect values from multiple threads.
For example, if there is a running tally of outputs, or if the maximum return
value must be retained, this is a way to do it.
.PP
These function can be thought of as akin to (but not replicating exactly) the
following code:
.RS
.PP
unsigned int i;
.br
for (i =
.IR start ;
i <
.IR stop ;
i ++) {
.RS
.br
.I func
.RI "(NULL, " argptr ,
ret);
.br
.I acc
(tmp, ret);
.RE
.br
}
.RE
.PP
One qthread (or future) is spawned for each shepherd. The set of values of
.I i
(iterations) is divided evenly among the shepherds, and each qthread
(or future) is assigned a set of iterations to perform.
.PP
The
.I func
argument must be a function pointer with a
.B qt_loopr_f
prototype. Note that this is NOT the same as
.B qt_loop_f
functions, as it has the extra
.I ret
argument. Its basic code structure is expected to look like this:
.RS
.PP
void
.B func
(qthread_t *me, const size_t startat,
.ti +10
const size_t stopat,
.RI "void *" argptr ,
void *ret)
.br
{
.RS
.br
for (unsigned int i = startat; i < stopat; i++) {
.RS
.br
/* do work */
.RE
.br
}
.RE
.br
}
.RE
.PP
The arguments
.I startat
and
.I stopat
are determined by the library, and tell the function what range of
.I i
values (iterations) it is responsible for.
.BR qt_loop_balance ()
and
.BR qt_loop_balance_future ()
will not return until all of the qthreads (or futures) it spawned have exited.
.PP
The
.I acc
argument must be a function pointer with a
.B qt_accum_f
prototype. This prototype looks like this:
.RS
.PP
void
.B acc
(void *a, void *b);
.RE
.PP
The accumulating value is stored in the memory pointed to by the
.I a
argument, and a new value is passed in via the
.I b
argument. Keep in mind that when there is only a single shepherd, this function
is never called, as the entire set of iterations will be given to a single
instance of
.I func
to perform. Because of this, and because there is no guarantee as to how the
iterations will be divided,
.I func
is expected to perform essentially the same accumulation operation that
.I acc
does. There is also no guarantee as to what order things will be accumulated
in, so the operation needs to be commutative if all runs of the program are
expected to return the same result.
.PP
The result of the accumulations
.RI ( acc ),
if any, of the output
.RI ( ret )
of
.I func
will be stored in the memory pointed to by
.IR out .
This memory is assumed to be at least
.I size
bytes, and
.I size
bytes will be used for storage of all
.I ret
arguments to
.I func
calls.
.SH EXAMPLE
Since this is a bit complicated a simple example may be useful. The example is
the
.BR qt_double_sum ()
function in the library; for simplicity's sake, the
.I checkfeb
option has been removed from this example. This function is extremely simple:
.PP
double qt_double_sum (double *array,
.ti +22
size_t length)
.br
{
.RS
double ret;
.br
.B qt_loopaccum_balance_future
(0, length, sizeof(double),
.ti +29
&ret, qtds_worker, array,
.ti +29
qtds_acc);
.br
return ret;
.RE
}
.PP
There are two function arguments to the
.BR qt_loopaccum_balance_future ()
call,
.I qtds_worker
(as the
.I func
argument) and
.I qtds_acc
(as the
.I acc
or "accumulator" argument).
.I qtds_acc
is extremely simple:
.PP
static void qtds_acc (void *a, void *b)
.br
{
.RS
*(double*)a += *(double*)b;
.RE
}
.PP
The
.I qtds_worker
function does the real work of adding up the numbers:
.PP
static void qtds_worker (qthread_t *me,
const size_t startat,
.ti +25
const size_t stopat,
void *array,
void *ret)
.br
{
.RS
size_t i;
.br
double sum = (double *)array[startat];
.br
for (i = startat + 1; i < stopat; i++) {
.RS
sum += (double *)array[i];
.RE
}
.br
*(double *)ret = sum;
.RE
}
