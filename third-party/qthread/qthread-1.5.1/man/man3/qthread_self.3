.SH NAME
.B qthread_self
\- retrieve the qthread_t pointer for the current thread
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <qthread.h>

.I qthread_t *
.br
.B qthread_self
(void);
.SH DESCRIPTION
This function allows a qthread to retrieve its qthread_t pointer.
.PP
This often relies on
.BR pthread_getspecific (),
which may be slow. On some architectures may cause a context-switch into the
kernel.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.BR qthread_self ()
will return either a pointer to the qthread_t structure associated with the
calling qthread, or if called from a non-qthread (i.e. a pthread or before
.BR qthread_initialize ()
has been called), will return NULL.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR qthread_id (3),
.BR qthread_shep (3)
