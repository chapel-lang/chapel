libhdfs3 README for Chapel
==========================

Chapel runtime support for HDFS using libhdfs3 can be built 
by setting CHPL_AUX_FILESYS=hdfs3.

For more information on the current support for libhdfs3 within Chapel,
please refer to $CHPL_HOME/doc/rst/technotes/auxIO.rst.  For more
information about libhdfs3 itself, please refer to the website: 
https://github.com/PivotalRD/libhdfs3

libhdfs3 has the following build dependencies:

    cmake (2.8+)                    http://www.cmake.org/
    boost (tested on 1.53+)         http://www.boost.org/
    google protobuf                 http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/
    libxml2                         http://www.xmlsoft.org/
    kerberos                        http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/
    libuuid                         http://sourceforge.net/projects/libuuid/
    libgsasl                        http://www.gnu.org/software/gsasl/

Instructions

To use Chapel's third-party build support for libhdfs3, change directory to 
$CHPL_HOME/third-party/libhdfs3 and type 'make'.

When the build completes all of libhdfs3's header files and library files 
will be installed into a subdirectory in $CHPL_HOME/third-party/libhdfs3/install

To complete building Chapel with libhdfs3 support, set the following
environment variables - this README assumes a linux64-gnu build environment:

export CHPL_AUX_FILESYS=hdfs3
export CHPL_AUXIO_INCLUDE=-I$CHPL_HOME/third-party/libhdfs3/install/linux64-gnu/include/hdfs
export CHPL_AUXIO_LIBS=-L$CHPL_HOME/third-party/libhdfs3/install/linux64-gnu/lib

Change directory to $CHPL_HOME, complete setting the rest of your Chapel runtime 
build configuration variables (as needed), and follow the remaining Chapel compile
instructions.
