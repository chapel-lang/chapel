Chapel third-party directory
============================

This directory is designed to hold sources that were not developed by
the Chapel team and which are released under distinct licenses from
Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:


chpldoc-venv/

  Summary: Directory where several python packages are downloaded and installed
           when running 'make chpldoc-venv' in the third-party directory. See
           requirements.txt and virtualenv.txt files for a complete list of
           packages that are installed.

  License: Varies, see chpldoc-venv/README.md

  Website: Varies, see chpldoc-venv/README.md


dlmalloc/
  Summary: Doug Lea's memory allocator (dlmalloc) which we use to
           support malloc/free calls when running GASNet programs
           using segment fast.

  License: dlmalloc has been placed in the public domain as explained
           at http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

  Website: http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

dygraphs/
  Summary: Dan Vanderkam's JavaScript charting library, which we use
           to display our performance data.

  License: MIT (see top of dygraphs/dygraph-combined.js file)

  Website: http://dygraphs.com


gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.

  License: GASNet is made available under a BSD-style license, which
           can be found in gasnet/GASNet-<version>/license.txt

gmp/
  Summary: the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library

  License: L-GPL (see gmp/gmp-*/COPYING and gmp/gmp-*/COPYING.LIB)

  Website: http://gmplib.org

  See also: gmp/README and gmp/gmp-*/README


hwloc/

  Summary: The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package
           provides a portable abstraction of the hierarchical
           topology of modern architectures.

  License: BSD (see hwloc/hwloc-*/COPYING)

  Website: http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc

llvm/
  Summary: This directory holds LLVM and Clang.  LLVM is provided as
           an optional back-end target in place of C (see
           doc/technotes/README.llvm for details).  CLANG is used to
           support "extern blocks" within Chapel -- a capability for
           embedding C code into a Chapel source file.

massivethreads/
  Summary: MassiveThreads is a lightweight thread library being
           developed by the University of Tokyo.  This package
           represents a lighter-weight tasking alternative
           to the default fifo/pthreads choice.

qthread/ 
  Summary: the Qthreads user-level tasking package being developed by
           Sandia National Laboratory.  We are working on using this
           as a lighter-weight tasking alternative to pthreads.

  License: Qthreads is released under the New BSD License, which can
           be found in qthread/qthread-<version>/COPYING

re2/
  Summary: This is a directory where the RE2 regular expression
           library will be downloaded when running 'make re2' in the
           third-party directory.  We use RE2 to support regular
           expression operations as described in
           doc/technotes/README.regexp).

  License: New BSD license (see re2/re2/LICENSE)
