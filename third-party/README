This directory is designed to hold sources that were not developed by
the Chapel team and which are released under distinct licenses from
Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:

dlmalloc/
  Summary: Doug Lea's memory allocator (dlmalloc) which we use to
           support malloc/free calls when running GASNet programs
           using segment fast.

  License: dlmalloc has been placed in the public domain as explained
           at http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.

massivethreads/
  Summary: MassiveThreads is a lightweight thread library being
           developed by the University of Tokyo.  This package
           represents another lighter-weight tasking alternative
           to the default fifo/pthreads choice.

nanox/
  Summary: the Nanos++ user-level tasking library being developed by
           Barcelona Supercompting Center (BSC).  We are working on
           using this as a lighter-weight tasking alternative to
           pthreads.

  License: Nanos++ is made available under an L-GPL license (see
           nanox-<version>/COPYING and COPYING.LESSER)

qthread/ 
  Summary: the Qthreads user-level tasking package being developed by
           Sandia National Laboratory.  We are working on using this
           as a lighter-weight tasking alternative to pthreads.

tcmalloc/
  Summary: the Google perf-tools memory allocator (tcmalloc) which we
           use to support malloc/free calls when running programs using
           Cray's Gemini network interconnect chip
