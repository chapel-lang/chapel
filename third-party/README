llvm/
  Summary: This directory holds LLVM and Clang.  LLVM is provided as
           an optional back-end target in place of C (see
           doc/rst/technotes/llvm.rst for details).  CLANG is used to
           support "extern blocks" within Chapel -- a capability for
           embedding C code into a Chapel source file.
