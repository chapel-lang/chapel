Chapel third-party directory
============================

This directory is designed to hold sources that were not developed by
the Chapel team and which are released under distinct licenses from
Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:


chpl-venv/
  Summary: Directory where several python packages are downloaded and
           installed. Used for chpldoc and the testing system. See
           chpldoc-requirements.txt, test-requirements.txt, and
           virtualenv.txt files for a complete list of packages that are
           installed.

  License: Varies, see chpl-venv/README.md

  Website: Varies, see chpl-venv/README.md


dlmalloc/
  Summary: Doug Lea's memory allocator (dlmalloc) is a portable
           allocator that can be used when a shared heap is required.

  License: dlmalloc has been placed in the public domain as explained
           at http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

  Website: http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html

gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.

  License: GASNet is made available under a BSD-style license, which
           can be found in gasnet/GASNet-<version>/license.txt

hwloc/
  Summary: The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package
           provides a portable abstraction of the hierarchical
           topology of modern architectures.

  License: BSD (see hwloc/hwloc-<version>/COPYING)

  Website: http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc

  See also: hwloc/README and hwloc/hwloc-<version>/README


jemalloc/
  Summary: Jason Evan's memory allocator (jemalloc) which "emphasizes
           fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support."

  License: jemalloc is released under a BSD-derived License (see
           jemalloc/jemalloc-*/COPYING)

llvm/
  Summary: This directory holds LLVM and Clang.  LLVM is provided as
           an optional back-end target in place of C (see
           doc/technotes/llvm.rst for details).  CLANG is used to
           support "extern blocks" within Chapel -- a capability for
           embedding C code into a Chapel source file.
