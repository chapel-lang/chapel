Chapel third-party directory
============================

This directory is designed to hold sources that were not developed by
the Chapel team and which are released under distinct licenses from
Chapel itself.  Current subdirectories include:


chpl-venv/
  Summary: Directory where several python packages are downloaded and
           installed. Used by chpldoc and the testing system, and to generate
           the man page and standard module documentation.
           See chpldoc-requirements.txt, test-requirements.txt, and
           virtualenv.txt files for a complete list of packages that are
           installed.

gasnet/
  Summary: the Berkeley GASNet library for one-sided communication
           which we use as a communication layer to implement Chapel's
           support for multi-locale/distributed-memory systems.

  License: GASNet is made available under a BSD-style license, which
           can be found in gasnet/gasnet-src/license.txt

hwloc/
  Summary: The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package
           provides a portable abstraction of the hierarchical
           topology of modern architectures.

  License: BSD (see hwloc/hwloc-src/COPYING)

  Website: http://www.open-mpi.org/projects/hwloc

  See also: hwloc/README and hwloc/hwloc-src/README


jemalloc/
  Summary: Jason Evan's memory allocator (jemalloc) which "emphasizes
           fragmentation avoidance and scalable concurrency support."
           and can be used when a shared heap is required.

  License: jemalloc is released under a BSD-derived License (see
           jemalloc/jemalloc-src/COPYING)

llvm/
  Summary: This directory holds LLVM and Clang.  LLVM is provided as
           an optional back-end target in place of C (see
           doc/rst/technotes/llvm.rst for details).  CLANG is used to
           support "extern blocks" within Chapel -- a capability for
           embedding C code into a Chapel source file.
