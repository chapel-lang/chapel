.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Registered memory regions associate memory buffers with permissions
granted for access by fabric resources.
A memory buffer must be registered with a resource domain before it can
be used as the target of a remote RMA or atomic data transfer.
Additionally, a fabric provider may require that data buffers be
registered before being used in local transfers.
Memory registration restrictions are controlled using a separate set of
mode bits, specified through the domain attributes (mr_mode field).
.PP
The following apply to memory registration.
.TP
.B \f[I]Scalable Memory Registration\f[]
By default, memory registration is considered scalable.
(For library versions 1.4 and earlier, this is indicated by setting
mr_mode to FI_MR_SCALABLE, with the fi_info mode bit FI_LOCAL_MR set to
0).
For versions 1.5 and later, scalable is implied by the lack of any
mr_mode bits being set.
The setting of mr_mode bits therefore adjusts application behavior as
described below.
Default, scalable registration has several properties.
.RS
.RE
.PP
In scalable mode, registration occurs on memory address ranges.
Because registration refers to memory regions, versus data buffers, the
address ranges given for a registration request do not need to map to
data buffers allocated by the application at the time the registration
call is made.
That is, an application can register any range of addresses in their
virtual address space, whether or not those addresses are backed by
physical pages or have been allocated.
.PP
The resulting memory regions are accessible by peers starting at a base
address of 0.
That is, the target address that is specified is a byte offset into the
registered region.
.PP
The application also selects the access key associated with the MR.
The key size is restricted to a maximum of 8 bytes.
.PP
With scalable registration, locally accessed data buffers are not
registered.
This includes source buffers for all transmit operations \-\- sends,
tagged sends, RMA, and atomics \-\- as well as buffers posted for
receive and tagged receive operations.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_LOCAL\f[]
When the FI_MR_LOCAL mode bit is set, applications must register all
data buffers that will be accessed by the local hardware and provide a
valid desc parameter into applicable data transfer operations.
When FI_MR_LOCAL is zero, applications are not required to register data
buffers before using them for local operations (e.g.
send and receive data buffers).
The desc parameter into data transfer operations will be ignored in this
case, unless otherwise required (e.g.
se FI_MR_HMEM).
It is recommended that applications pass in NULL for desc when not
required.
.RS
.RE
.PP
A provider may hide local registration requirements from applications by
making use of an internal registration cache or similar mechanisms.
Such mechanisms, however, may negatively impact performance for some
applications, notably those which manage their own network buffers.
In order to support as broad range of applications as possible, without
unduly affecting their performance, applications that wish to manage
their own local memory registrations may do so by using the memory
registration calls.
.PP
Note: the FI_MR_LOCAL mr_mode bit replaces the FI_LOCAL_MR fi_info mode
bit.
When FI_MR_LOCAL is set, FI_LOCAL_MR is ignored.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_RAW\f[]
Raw memory regions are used to support providers with keys larger than
64\-bits or require setup at the peer.
When the FI_MR_RAW bit is set, applications must use fi_mr_raw_attr()
locally and fi_mr_map_raw() at the peer before targeting a memory region
as part of any data transfer request.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR\f[]
The FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR bit indicates that the provider references memory
regions by virtual address, rather than a 0\-based offset.
Peers that target memory regions registered with FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR specify
the destination memory buffer using the target\[aq]s virtual address,
with any offset into the region specified as virtual address + offset.
Support of this bit typically implies that peers must exchange
addressing data prior to initiating any RMA or atomic operation.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_ALLOCATED\f[]
When set, all registered memory regions must be backed by physical
memory pages at the time the registration call is made.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_PROV_KEY\f[]
This memory region mode indicates that the provider does not support
application requested MR keys.
MR keys are returned by the provider.
Applications that support FI_MR_PROV_KEY can obtain the provider key
using fi_mr_key(), unless FI_MR_RAW is also set.
The returned key should then be exchanged with peers prior to initiating
an RMA or atomic operation.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_MMU_NOTIFY\f[]
FI_MR_MMU_NOTIFY is typically set by providers that support memory
registration against memory regions that are not necessarily backed by
allocated physical pages at the time the memory registration occurs.
(That is, FI_MR_ALLOCATED is typically 0).
However, such providers require that applications notify the provider
prior to the MR being accessed as part of a data transfer operation.
This notification informs the provider that all necessary physical pages
now back the region.
The notification is necessary for providers that cannot hook directly
into the operating system page tables or memory management unit.
See fi_mr_refresh() for notification details.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_RMA_EVENT\f[]
This mode bit indicates that the provider must configure memory regions
that are associated with RMA events prior to their use.
This includes all memory regions that are associated with completion
counters.
When set, applications must indicate if a memory region will be
associated with a completion counter as part of the region\[aq]s
creation.
This is done by passing in the FI_RMA_EVENT flag to the memory
registration call.
.RS
.RE
.PP
Such memory regions will be created in a disabled state and must be
associated with all completion counters prior to being enabled.
To enable a memory region, the application must call fi_mr_enable().
After calling fi_mr_enable(), no further resource bindings may be made
to the memory region.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_ENDPOINT\f[]
This mode bit indicates that the provider associates memory regions with
endpoints rather than domains.
Memory regions that are registered with the provider are created in a
disabled state and must be bound to an endpoint prior to being enabled.
To bind the MR with an endpoint, the application must use fi_mr_bind().
To enable the memory region, the application must call fi_mr_enable().
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_HMEM\f[]
This mode bit is associated with the FI_HMEM capability.
If FI_MR_HMEM is set, the application must register buffers that were
allocated using a device call and provide a valid desc parameter into
applicable data transfer operations even if they are only used for local
operations (e.g.
send and receive data buffers).
Device memory must be registered using the fi_mr_regattr call, with the
iface and device fields filled out.
.RS
.RE
.PP
If FI_MR_HMEM is set, but FI_MR_LOCAL is unset, only device buffers must
be registered when used locally.
In this case, the desc parameter passed into data transfer operations
must either be valid or NULL.
Similarly, if FI_MR_LOCAL is set, but FI_MR_HMEM is not, the desc
parameter must either be valid or NULL.
.TP
.B \f[I]Basic Memory Registration\f[]
Basic memory registration is indicated by the FI_MR_BASIC mr_mode bit.
FI_MR_BASIC is maintained for backwards compatibility (libfabric version
1.4 or earlier).
The behavior of basic registration is equivalent to setting the
following mr_mode bits to one: FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR, FI_MR_ALLOCATED, and
FI_MR_PROV_KEY.
Additionally, providers that support basic registration usually required
the fi_info mode bit FI_LOCAL_MR.
As a result, it is recommended that applications migrating from
libfabric 1.4 or earlier or wanting to support basic memory registration
set the mr_mode to FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR | FI_MR_ALLOCATED | FI_MR_PROV_KEY |
FI_MR_LOCAL.
FI_MR_BASIC must be set alone.
Other mr_mode bit pairings are invalid.
Unlike other mr_mode bits, if FI_MR_BASIC is set on input to
fi_getinfo(), it will not be cleared by the provider.
That is, setting FI_MR_BASIC to one requests basic registration.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The registrations functions \-\- fi_mr_reg, fi_mr_regv, and
fi_mr_regattr \-\- are used to register one or more memory regions with
fabric resources.
The main difference between registration functions are the number and
type of parameters that they accept as input.
Otherwise, they perform the same general function.
.PP
By default, memory registration completes synchronously.
I.e.
the registration call will not return until the registration has
completed.
Memory registration can complete asynchronous by binding the resource
domain to an event queue using the FI_REG_MR flag.
See fi_domain_bind.
When memory registration is asynchronous, in order to avoid a race
condition between the registration call returning and the corresponding
reading of the event from the EQ, the mr output parameter will be
written before any event associated with the operation may be read by
the application.
An asynchronous event will not be generated unless the registration call
returns success (0).
.SS fi_mr_reg
.PP
The fi_mr_reg call registers the user\-specified memory buffer with the
resource domain.
The buffer is enabled for access by the fabric hardware based on the
provided access permissions.
See the access field description for memory region attributes below.
.PP
Registered memory is associated with a local memory descriptor and,
optionally, a remote memory key.
A memory descriptor is a provider specific identifier associated with
registered memory.
Memory descriptors often map to hardware specific indices or keys
associated with the memory region.
Remote memory keys provide limited protection against unwanted access by
a remote node.
Remote accesses to a memory region must provide the key associated with
the registration.
.PP
Because MR keys must be provided by a remote process, an application can
use the requested_key parameter to indicate that a specific key value be
returned.
Support for user requested keys is provider specific and is determined
by the mr_mode domain attribute.
.PP
Remote RMA and atomic operations indicate the location within a
registered memory region by specifying an address.
The location is referenced by adding the offset to either the base
virtual address of the buffer or to 0, depending on the mr_mode.
.PP
The offset parameter is reserved for future use and must be 0.
.PP
For asynchronous memory registration requests, the result will be
reported to the user through an event queue associated with the resource
domain.
If successful, the allocated memory region structure will be returned to
the user through the mr parameter.
The mr address must remain valid until the registration operation
completes.
The context specified with the registration request is returned with the
completion event.
.SS fi_mr_regv
.PP
The fi_mr_regv call adds support for a scatter\-gather list to
fi_mr_reg.
Multiple memory buffers are registered as a single memory region.
Otherwise, the operation is the same.
.SS fi_mr_regattr
.PP
The fi_mr_regattr call is a more generic, extensible registration call
that allows the user to specify the registration request using a struct
fi_mr_attr (defined below).
.SS fi_close
.PP
Fi_close is used to release all resources associated with a registering
a memory region.
Once unregistered, further access to the registered memory is not
guaranteed.
Active or queued operations that reference a memory region being closed
may fail or result in accesses to invalid memory.
Applications are responsible for ensuring that a MR is no longer needed
prior to closing it.
Note that accesses to a closed MR from a remote peer will result in an
error at the peer.
The state of the local endpoint will be unaffected.
.PP
When closing the MR, there must be no opened endpoints or counters
associated with the MR.
If resources are still associated with the MR when attempting to close,
the call will return \-FI_EBUSY.
.SS fi_mr_desc
.PP
Obtains the local memory descriptor associated with a MR.
The memory registration must have completed successfully before invoking
this call.
.SS fi_mr_key
.PP
Returns the remote protection key associated with a MR.
The memory registration must have completed successfully before invoking
this.
The returned key may be used in data transfer operations at a peer.
If the FI_RAW_MR mode bit has been set for the domain, then the memory
key must be obtained using the fi_mr_raw_key function instead.
A return value of FI_KEY_NOTAVAIL will be returned if the registration
has not completed or a raw memory key is required.
.SS fi_mr_raw_attr
.PP
Returns the raw, remote protection key and base address associated with
a MR.
The memory registration must have completed successfully before invoking
this routine.
Use of this call is required if the FI_RAW_MR mode bit has been set by
the provider; however, it is safe to use this call with any memory
region.
.PP
On input, the key_size parameter should indicate the size of the raw_key
buffer.
If the actual key is larger than what can fit into the buffer, it will
return \-FI_ETOOSMALL.
On output, key_size is set to the size of the buffer needed to store the
key, which may be larger than the input value.
The needed key_size can also be obtained through the mr_key_size domain
attribute (fi_domain_attr) field.
.PP
A raw key must be mapped by a peer before it can be used in data
transfer operations.
See fi_mr_map_raw below.
.SS fi_mr_map_raw
.PP
Raw protection keys must be mapped to a usable key value before they can
be used for data transfer operations.
The mapping is done by the peer that initiates the RMA or atomic
operation.
The mapping function takes as input the raw key and its size, and
returns the mapped key.
Use of the fi_mr_map_raw function is required if the peer has the
FI_RAW_MR mode bit set, but this routine may be called on any valid key.
All mapped keys must be freed by calling fi_mr_unmap_key when access to
the peer memory region is no longer necessary.
.SS fi_mr_unmap_key
.PP
This call releases any resources that may have been allocated as part of
mapping a raw memory key.
All mapped keys must be freed before the corresponding domain is closed.
.SS fi_mr_bind
.PP
The fi_mr_bind function associates a memory region with a counter or
endpoint.
Counter bindings are needed by providers that support the generation of
completions based on fabric operations.
Endpoint bindings are needed if the provider associates memory regions
with endpoints (see FI_MR_ENDPOINT).
.PP
When binding with a counter, the type of events tracked against the
memory region is based on the bitwise OR of the following flags.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_REMOTE_WRITE\f[]
Generates an event whenever a remote RMA write or atomic operation
modifies the memory region.
Use of this flag requires that the endpoint through which the MR is
accessed be created with the FI_RMA_EVENT capability.
.RS
.RE
.PP
When binding the memory region to an endpoint, flags should be 0.
.SS fi_mr_refresh
.PP
The use of this call is required to notify the provider of any change to
the physical pages backing a registered memory region if the
FI_MR_MMU_NOTIFY mode bit has been set.
This call informs the provider that the page table entries associated
with the region may have been modified, and the provider should verify
and update the registered region accordingly.
The iov parameter is optional and may be used to specify which portions
of the registered region requires updating.
Providers are only guaranteed to update the specified address ranges.
.PP
The refresh operation has the effect of disabling and re\-enabling
access to the registered region.
Any operations from peers that attempt to access the region will fail
while the refresh is occurring.
Additionally, attempts to access the region by the local process through
libfabric APIs may result in a page fault or other fatal operation.
.PP
The fi_mr_refresh call is only needed if the physical pages might have
been updated after the memory region was created.
.SS fi_mr_enable
.PP
The enable call is used with memory registration associated with the
FI_MR_RMA_EVENT mode bit.
Memory regions created in the disabled state must be explicitly enabled
after being fully configured by the application.
Any resource bindings to the MR must be done prior to enabling the MR.
.SH MEMORY REGION ATTRIBUTES
.PP
Memory regions are created using the following attributes.
The struct fi_mr_attr is passed into fi_mr_regattr, but individual

Note that some providers may not enforce fine grained access

This allows applications to use well known key values, which can avoid
applications needing to exchange and store keys.
Support for user requested keys is provider specific and is determined

.RE
.SH NOTES
.PP
Direct access to an application\[aq]s memory by a remote peer requires
that the application register the targeted memory buffer(s).
This is typically done by calling one of the fi_mr_reg* routines.
For FI_MR_PROV_KEY, the provider will return a key that must be used by
the peer when accessing the memory region.
The application is responsible for transferring this key to the peer.
If FI_MR_RAW mode has been set, the key must be retrieved using the
fi_mr_raw_attr function.
.PP
FI_RAW_MR allows support for providers that require more than 8\-bytes
for their protection keys or need additional setup before a key can be
used for transfers.
After a raw key has been retrieved, it must be exchanged with the remote
peer.
The peer must use fi_mr_map_raw to convert the raw key into a usable
64\-bit key.
The mapping must be done even if the raw key is 64\-bits or smaller.
.PP
The raw key support functions are usable with all registered memory
regions, even if FI_MR_RAW has not been set.
It is recommended that portable applications target using those
interfaces; however, their use does carry extra message and memory
footprint overhead, making it less desirable for highly scalable apps.

.SH MEMORY REGISTRATION CACHE
.PP
Many hardware NICs accessed by libfabric require that data buffers be
registered with the hardware while the hardware accesses it.
This ensures that the virtual to physical address mappings for those
buffers do not change while the transfer is occurring.
The performance impact of registering memory regions can be significant.
As a result, some providers make use of a registration cache,
particularly when working with applications that are unable to manage
their own network buffers.
A registration cache avoids the overhead of registering and
unregistering a data buffer with each transfer.
.PP
As a general rule, if hardware requires the FI_MR_LOCAL mode bit
described above, but this is not supported by the application, a memory
registration cache \f[I]may\f[] be in use.
The following environment variables may be used to configure
registration caches.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_SIZE\f[]
This defines the total number of bytes for all memory regions that may
be tracked by the cache.
If not set, the cache has no limit on how many bytes may be registered
and cached.
Setting this will reduce the amount of memory that is not actively being
used as part of a data transfer that is registered with a provider.
By default, the cache size is unlimited.

.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_COUNT\f[]
This defines the total number of memory regions that may be registered
with the cache.
If not set, a default limit is chosen.
Setting this will reduce the number of regions that are registered,
regardless of their size, which are not actively being used as part of a
data transfer.
Setting this to zero will disable registration caching.

.B \f[I]FI_MR_CACHE_MONITOR\f[]
The cache monitor is responsible for detecting changes made between the
virtual addresses used by an application and the underlying physical
pages.
Valid monitor options are: userfaultfd, memhooks, and disabled.
Selecting disabled will turn off the registration cache.
Userfaultfd is a Linux kernel feature used to report virtual to physical
address mapping changes to user space.
Memhooks operates by intercepting relevant memory allocation and
deallocation calls which may result in the mappings changing, such as
malloc, mmap, free, etc.
Note that memhooks operates at the elf linker layer, and does not use
glibc memory hooks.
