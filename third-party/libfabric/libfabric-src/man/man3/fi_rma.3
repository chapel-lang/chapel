.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
RMA (remote memory access) operations are used to transfer data directly
between a local data buffer and a remote data buffer.
RMA transfers occur on a byte level granularity, and no message
boundaries are maintained.
.PP
The write functions \[en] fi_write, fi_writev, fi_writemsg,
fi_inject_write, and fi_writedata \[en] are used to transmit data into a
remote memory buffer.
The main difference between write functions are the number and type of
parameters that they accept as input.
Otherwise, they perform the same general function.
.PP
The read functions \[en] fi_read, fi_readv, and fi_readmsg \[en] are
used to transfer data from a remote memory region into local data
buffer(s).
Similar to the write operations, read operations operate asynchronously.
Users should not touch the posted data buffer(s) until the read
operation has completed.
.PP
Completed RMA operations are reported to the user through one or more
completion queues associated with the endpoint.
Users provide context which are associated with each operation, and is
returned to the user as part of the completion.
See fi_cq for completion event details.
.PP
By default, the remote endpoint does not generate an event or notify the
user when a memory region has been accessed by an RMA read or write
operation.
However, immediate data may be associated with an RMA write operation.
RMA writes with immediate data will generate a completion entry at the
remote endpoint, so that the immediate data may be delivered.
.SS fi_write
.PP
The call fi_write transfers the data contained in the user-specified
data buffer to a remote memory region.
.SS fi_writev
.PP
The fi_writev call adds support for a scatter-gather list to fi_write.
The fi_writev transfers the set of data buffers referenced by the iov
parameter to the remote memory region.
.SS fi_writemsg
.PP
The fi_writemsg call supports data transfers over both connected and
connectionless endpoints, with the ability to control the write
operation per call through the use of flags.
The fi_writemsg function takes a struct fi_msg_rma as input.

struct fi_msg_rma {
    const struct iovec *msg_iov;     /* local scatter-gather array */
    void               **desc;       /* operation descriptor */
    size_t             iov_count;    /* # elements in msg_iov */
    fi_addr_t          addr;        /* optional endpoint address */

struct fi_rma_iov {
    uint64_t           addr;         /* target RMA address */
    size_t             len;          /* size of target buffer */
    uint64_t           key;          /* access key */
};

.fi
.SS fi_inject_write
.PP
The write inject call is an optimized version of fi_write.
It provides similar completion semantics as fi_inject
\f[C]fi_msg\f[R](3).
.SS fi_writedata
.PP
The write data call is similar to fi_write, but allows for the sending
of remote CQ data (see FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA flag) as part of the transfer.
.SS fi_inject_writedata
.PP
The inject write data call is similar to fi_inject_write, but allows for
the sending of remote CQ data (see FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA flag) as part of
the transfer.
.SS fi_read
.PP
The fi_read call requests that the remote endpoint transfer data from
the remote memory region into the local data buffer.
.SS fi_readv
.PP
The fi_readv call adds support for a scatter-gather list to fi_read.
The fi_readv transfers data from the remote memory region into the set
of data buffers referenced by the iov parameter.
.SS fi_readmsg
.PP
The fi_readmsg call supports data transfers over both connected and
connectionless endpoints, with the ability to control the read operation
per call through the use of flags.
The fi_readmsg function takes a struct fi_msg_rma as input.
.SH FLAGS
.PP
The fi_readmsg and fi_writemsg calls allow the user to specify flags
which can change the default data transfer operation.
Flags specified with fi_readmsg / fi_writemsg override most flags
previously configured with the endpoint, except where noted (see
fi_endpoint.3).
The following list of flags are usable with fi_readmsg and/or
fi_writemsg.
.TP
\f[I]FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA\f[R]
Applies to fi_writemsg and fi_writedata.
Indicates that remote CQ data is available and should be sent as part of
the request.
See fi_getinfo for additional details on FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA.
.TP
\f[I]FI_COMPLETION\f[R]
Indicates that a completion entry should be generated for the specified
operation.
The endpoint must be bound to a completion queue with
FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION that corresponds to the specified operation, or
this flag is ignored.
.TP
\f[I]FI_MORE\f[R]
Indicates that the user has additional requests that will immediately be
posted after the current call returns.
Use of this flag may improve performance by enabling the provider to
optimize its access to the fabric hardware.
.TP
\f[I]FI_INJECT\f[R]
Applies to fi_writemsg.
Indicates that the outbound data buffer should be returned to user
immediately after the write call returns, even if the operation is
handled asynchronously.
This may require that the underlying provider implementation copy the
data into a local buffer and transfer out of that buffer.
This flag can only be used with messages smaller than inject_size.
.TP
\f[I]FI_INJECT_COMPLETE\f[R]
Applies to fi_writemsg.
Indicates that a completion should be generated when the source
buffer(s) may be reused.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE\f[R]
Applies to fi_writemsg.
Indicates that a completion should not be generated until the operation
has been successfully transmitted and is no longer being tracked by the
provider.
.TP
\f[I]FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE\f[R]
Applies to fi_writemsg.
Indicates that a completion should be generated when the operation has
been processed by the destination.
.TP
\f[I]FI_COMMIT_COMPLETE\f[R]
Applies to fi_writemsg when targeting persistent memory regions.
Indicates that a completion should be generated only after the result of
the operation has been made durable.
.TP
\f[I]FI_FENCE\f[R]
Applies to transmits.
Indicates that the requested operation, also known as the fenced
operation, and any operation posted after the fenced operation will be
deferred until all previous operations targeting the same peer endpoint
have completed.
Operations posted after the fencing will see and/or replace the results
of any operations initiated prior to the fenced operation.
.PP
The ordering of operations starting at the posting of the fenced
operation (inclusive) to the posting of a subsequent fenced operation
(exclusive) is controlled by the endpoint\[cq]s ordering semantics.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
Returns 0 on success.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[R].
.SH ERRORS
.TP
\f[I]-FI_EAGAIN\f[R]
See \f[C]fi_msg\f[R](3) for a detailed description of handling
FI_EAGAIN.
