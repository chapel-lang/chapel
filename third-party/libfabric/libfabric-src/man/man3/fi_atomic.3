.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Atomic transfers are used to read and update data located in remote
memory regions in an atomic fashion.
Conceptually, they are similar to local atomic operations of a similar
nature (e.g.
atomic increment, compare and swap, etc.).
Updates to remote data involve one of several operations on the data,
and act on specific types of data, as listed below.
As such, atomic transfers have knowledge of the format of the data being
accessed.
A single atomic function may operate across an array of data applying an
atomic operation to each entry, but the atomicity of an operation is
limited to a single datatype or entry.
.SS Atomic Data Types
.PP
Atomic functions may operate on one of the following identified data
types.
A given atomic function may support any datatype, subject to provider
implementation constraints.

.SS Atomic Operations
.PP
The following atomic operations are defined.
An atomic operation often acts against a target value in the remote
memory buffer and source value provided with the atomic function.
It may also carry source data to replace the target value in compare and
swap operations.
A conceptual description of each operation is provided.

.SS Base Atomic Functions
.PP
The base atomic functions \-\- fi_atomic, fi_atomicv, fi_atomicmsg \-\-
are used to transmit data to a remote node, where the specified atomic
operation is performed against the target data.
The result of a base atomic function is stored at the remote memory
region.
The main difference between atomic functions are the number and type of
parameters that they accept as input.
Otherwise, they perform the same general function.
.PP
The call fi_atomic transfers the data contained in the user\-specified
data buffer to a remote node.
For unconnected endpoints, the destination endpoint is specified through
the dest_addr parameter.
Unless the endpoint has been configured differently, the data buffer
passed into fi_atomic must not be touched by the application until the
fi_atomic call completes asynchronously.
The target buffer of a base atomic operation must allow for remote read
an/or write access, as appropriate.
.PP
The fi_atomicv call adds support for a scatter\-gather list to
fi_atomic.
The fi_atomicv transfers the set of data buffers referenced by the ioc
parameter to the remote node for processing.
.PP
The fi_inject_atomic call is an optimized version of fi_atomic.
The fi_inject_atomic function behaves as if the FI_INJECT transfer flag
were set, and FI_COMPLETION were not.
That is, the data buffer is available for reuse immediately on returning
from from fi_inject_atomic, and no completion event will be generated
for this atomic.
The completion event will be suppressed even if the endpoint has not
been configured with FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION.
See the flags discussion below for more details.
The requested message size that can be used with fi_inject_atomic is
limited by inject_size.
.PP
The fi_atomicmsg call supports atomic functions over both connected and
unconnected endpoints, with the ability to control the atomic operation
per call through the use of flags.
The fi_atomicmsg function takes a struct fi_msg_atomic as input.
.IP
.nf

The following list of atomic operations are usable with base atomic
operations: FI_MIN, FI_MAX, FI_SUM, FI_PROD, FI_LOR, FI_LAND, FI_BOR,
FI_BAND, FI_LXOR, FI_BXOR, and FI_ATOMIC_WRITE.
.SS Fetch\-Atomic Functions
.PP
The fetch atomic functions \-\- fi_fetch_atomic, fi_fetch_atomicv, and
fi_fetch atomicmsg \-\- behave similar to the equivalent base atomic
function.
The difference between the fetch and base atomic calls are the fetch
atomic routines return the initial value that was stored at the target
to the user.
The initial value is read into the user provided result buffer.
The target buffer of fetch\-atomic operations must be enabled for remote
read access.
.PP
The following list of atomic operations are usable with fetch atomic
operations: FI_MIN, FI_MAX, FI_SUM, FI_PROD, FI_LOR, FI_LAND, FI_BOR,
FI_BAND, FI_LXOR, FI_BXOR, FI_ATOMIC_READ, and FI_ATOMIC_WRITE.
.PP
For FI_ATOMIC_READ operations, the source buffer operand (e.g.
fi_fetch_atomic buf parameter) is ignored and may be NULL.
The results are written into the result buffer.
.SS Compare\-Atomic Functions
.PP
The compare atomic functions \-\- fi_compare_atomic, fi_compare_atomicv,
and fi_compare atomicmsg \-\- are used for operations that require
comparing the target data against a value before performing a swap
operation.
The compare atomic functions support: FI_CSWAP, FI_CSWAP_NE,
FI_CSWAP_LE, FI_CSWAP_LT, FI_CSWAP_GE, FI_CSWAP_GT, and FI_MSWAP.
.SS Atomic Valid Functions
.PP
The atomic valid functions \-\- fi_atomicvalid, fi_fetch_atomicvalid,
and fi_compare_atomicvalid \-\-indicate which operations the local
provider supports.
Needed operations not supported by the provider must be emulated by the
application.
Each valid call corresponds to a set of atomic functions.
fi_atomicvalid checks whether a provider supports a specific base atomic
operation for a given datatype and operation.
fi_fetch_atomicvalid indicates if a provider supports a specific
fetch\-atomic operation for a given datatype and operation.
And fi_compare_atomicvalid checks if a provider supports a specified
compare\-atomic operation for a given datatype and operation.
.PP
If an operation is supported, an atomic valid call will return 0, along
with a count of atomic data units that a single function call will
operate on.
.SS Query Atomic Attributes
.PP
The fi_query_atomic call acts as an enhanced atomic valid operation (see
the atomic valid function definitions above).
It is provided, in part, for future extensibility.
The query operation reports which atomic operations are supported by the
domain, for suitably configured endpoints.
.PP
The behavior of fi_query_atomic is adjusted based on the flags
parameter.
If flags is 0, then the operation reports the supported atomic
attributes for base atomic operations, similar to fi_atomicvalid for
endpoints.
If flags has the FI_FETCH_ATOMIC bit set, the operation behaves similar
to fi_fetch_atomicvalid.
Similarly, the flag bit FI_COMPARE_ATOMIC results in query acting as
fi_compare_atomicvalid.
The FI_FETCH_ATOMIC and FI_COMPARE_ATOMIC bits may not both be set.
.PP
If the FI_TAGGED bit is set, the provider will indicate if it supports
atomic operations to tagged receive buffers.
The FI_TAGGED bit may be used by itself, or in conjunction with the
FI_FETCH_ATOMIC and FI_COMPARE_ATOMIC flags.
.PP
The output of fi_query_atomic is struct fi_atomic_attr:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
struct\ fi_atomic_attr\ {
\ \ \ \ size_t\ count;
\ \ \ \ size_t\ size;
};
\f[]
.fi
.PP
The count attribute field is as defined for the atomic valid calls.
The size field indicates the size in bytes of the atomic datatype.
The size field is useful for datatypes that may differ in sizes based on
the platform or compiler, such FI_LONG_DOUBLE.
.SS Completions
.PP
Completed atomic operations are reported to the initiator of the request
through an associated completion queue or counter.
Any user provided context specified with the request will be returned as
part of any completion event written to a CQ.
See fi_cq for completion event details.
.PP
Any results returned to the initiator as part of an atomic operation
will be available prior to a completion event being generated.
This will be true even if the requested completion semantic provides a
weaker guarantee.
That is, atomic fetch operations have FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE semantics.
Completions generated for other types of atomic operations indicate that
it is safe to re\-use the source data buffers.
.PP
Any updates to data at the target of an atomic operation will be visible
to agents (CPU processes, NICs, and other devices) on the target node
prior to one of the following occurring.
If the atomic operation generates a completion event or updates a
completion counter at the target endpoint, the results will be available
prior to the completion notification.
After processing a completion for the atomic, if the initiator submits a
transfer between the same endpoints that generates a completion at the
target, the results will be available prior to the subsequent
transfer\[aq]s event.
Or, if a fenced data transfer from the initiator follows the atomic
request, the results will be available prior to a completion at the
target for the fenced transfer.
.PP
The correctness of atomic operations on a target memory region is
guaranteed only when performed by a single actor for a given window of
time.
An actor is defined as a single libfabric domain (identified by the
domain name, and not an open instance of that domain), a coherent CPU
complex, or other device (e.g.
GPU) capable of performing atomic operations on the target memory.
The results of atomic operations performed by multiple actors
simultaneously are undefined.
For example, issuing CPU based atomic operations to a target region
concurrently being updated by NIC based atomics may leave the
region\[aq]s data in an unknown state.
The results of a first actor\[aq]s atomic operations must be visible to
a second actor prior to the second actor issuing its own atomics.
.SH FLAGS
.PP
The fi_atomicmsg, fi_fetch_atomicmsg, and fi_compare_atomicmsg calls
allow the user to specify flags which can change the default data
transfer operation.
Flags specified with atomic message operations override most flags
previously configured with the endpoint, except where noted (see
fi_control).
The following list of flags are usable with atomic message calls.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_COMPLETION\f[]

operation.
The endpoint must be bound to a completion queue with
FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION that corresponds to the specified operation, or
this flag is ignored.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MORE\f[]
Indicates that the user has additional requests that will immediately be
posted after the current call returns.
Use of this flag may improve performance by enabling the provider to
optimize its access to the fabric hardware.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_INJECT\f[]
Indicates that the control of constant data buffers should be returned
to the user immediately after the call returns, even if the operation is
handled asynchronously.
This may require that the underlying provider implementation copy the
data into a local buffer and transfer out of that buffer.
Constant data buffers refers to any data buffer or iovec used by the
atomic APIs that are marked as \[aq]const\[aq].
Non\-constant or output buffers are unaffected by this flag and may be
accessed by the provider at anytime until the operation has completed.
This flag can only be used with messages smaller than inject_size.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_FENCE\f[]
Applies to transmits.
Indicates that the requested operation, also known as the fenced
operation, and any operation posted after the fenced operation will be
deferred until all previous operations targeting the same peer endpoint
have completed.
Operations posted after the fencing will see and/or replace the results
of any operations initiated prior to the fenced operation.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The ordering of operations starting at the posting of the fenced
operation (inclusive) to the posting of a subsequent fenced operation
(exclusive) is controlled by the endpoint\[aq]s ordering semantics.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[]
Specifies that the target of the atomic operation is a tagged receive
buffer instead of an RMA buffer.
When a tagged buffer is the target memory region, the addr parameter is
used as a 0\-based byte offset into the tagged buffer, with the key
parameter specifying the tag.

Returns 0 on success.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[].

.SH NOTES
.PP
Atomic operations operate on an array of values of a specific data type.
Atomicity is only guaranteed for each data type operation, not across
the entire array.
The following pseudo\-code demonstrates this operation for 64\-bit
unsigned atomic write.
ATOMIC_WRITE_U64 is a platform dependent macro that atomically writes 8
bytes to an aligned memory location.

.PP
The number of array elements to operate on is specified through a count
parameter.
This must be between 1 and the maximum returned through the relevant
valid operation, inclusive.
The requested operation and data type must also be valid for the given
provider.
.PP
The ordering of atomic operations carried as part of different request
messages is subject to the message and data ordering definitions
assigned to the transmitting and receiving endpoints.
Both message and data ordering are required if the results of two atomic
operations to the same memory buffers are to reflect the second
operation acting on the results of the first.
See \f[C]fi_endpoint\f[](3) for further details and message size
restrictions.
