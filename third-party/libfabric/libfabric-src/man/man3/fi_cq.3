.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Completion queues are used to report events associated with data
transfers.
They are associated with message sends and receives, RMA, atomic, tagged
messages, and triggered events.
Reported events are usually associated with a fabric endpoint, but may
also refer to memory regions used as the target of an RMA or atomic
operation.
.SS fi_cq_open
.PP
fi_cq_open allocates a new completion queue.
Unlike event queues, completion queues are associated with a resource
domain and may be offloaded entirely in provider hardware.
.PP
The properties and behavior of a completion queue are defined by
\f[C]struct fi_cq_attr\f[R].

.TP
.B \f[I]wait_obj\f[R]
CQ\[cq]s may be associated with a specific wait object.
Wait objects allow applications to block until the wait object is
signaled, indicating that a completion is available to be read.
Users may use fi_control to retrieve the underlying wait object
associated with a CQ, in order to use it in other system calls.
The following values may be used to specify the type of wait object
associated with a CQ: FI_WAIT_NONE, FI_WAIT_UNSPEC, FI_WAIT_SET,
FI_WAIT_FD, FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND, and FI_WAIT_YIELD.
The default is FI_WAIT_NONE.
.TP
.B \- \f[I]FI_WAIT_NONE\f[R]
Used to indicate that the user will not block (wait) for completions on
the CQ.
When FI_WAIT_NONE is specified, the application may not call fi_cq_sread
or fi_cq_sreadfrom.
.TP
.B \- \f[I]FI_WAIT_UNSPEC\f[R]
Specifies that the user will only wait on the CQ using fabric interface
calls, such as fi_cq_sread or fi_cq_sreadfrom.
In this case, the underlying provider may select the most appropriate or
highest performing wait object available, including custom wait
mechanisms.
Applications that select FI_WAIT_UNSPEC are not guaranteed to retrieve
the underlying wait object.
.TP
.B \- \f[I]FI_WAIT_SET\f[R]
Indicates that the completion queue should use a wait set object to wait
for completions.
If specified, the wait_set field must reference an existing wait set
object.
.TP
.B \- \f[I]FI_WAIT_FD\f[R]
Indicates that the CQ should use a file descriptor as its wait
mechanism.
A file descriptor wait object must be usable in select, poll, and epoll
routines.
However, a provider may signal an FD wait object by marking it as
readable, writable, or with an error.
.TP
.B \- \f[I]FI_WAIT_MUTEX_COND\f[R]
Specifies that the CQ should use a pthread mutex and cond variable as a
wait object.
.TP
.B \- \f[I]FI_WAIT_YIELD\f[R]
Indicates that the CQ will wait without a wait object but instead yield
on every wait.
Allows usage of fi_cq_sread and fi_cq_sreadfrom through a spin.
.TP
.B \f[I]signaling_vector\f[R]
If the FI_AFFINITY flag is set, this indicates the logical cpu number
(0..max cpu \- 1) that interrupts associated with the CQ should target.
This field should be treated as a hint to the provider and may be
ignored if the provider does not support interrupt affinity.
.TP
.B \f[I]wait_cond\f[R]
By default, when a completion is inserted into a CQ that supports
blocking reads (fi_cq_sread/fi_cq_sreadfrom), the corresponding wait
object is signaled.
Users may specify a condition that must first be met before the wait is
satisfied.
This field indicates how the provider should interpret the cond field,
which describes the condition needed to signal the wait object.
.PP
A wait condition should be treated as an optimization.
Providers are not required to meet the requirements of the condition
before signaling the wait object.
Applications should not rely on the condition necessarily being true
when a blocking read call returns.
.PP
If wait_cond is set to FI_CQ_COND_NONE, then no additional conditions
are applied to the signaling of the CQ wait object, and the insertion of
any new entry will trigger the wait condition.
If wait_cond is set to FI_CQ_COND_THRESHOLD, then the cond field is
interpreted as a size_t threshold value.
The threshold indicates the number of entries that are to be queued
before at the CQ before the wait is satisfied.
.PP
This field is ignored if wait_obj is set to FI_WAIT_NONE.
.TP
.B \f[I]wait_set\f[R]
If wait_obj is FI_WAIT_SET, this field references a wait object to which
the completion queue should attach.
When an event is inserted into the completion queue, the corresponding
wait set will be signaled if all necessary conditions are met.
The use of a wait_set enables an optimized method of waiting for events
across multiple event and completion queues.
This field is ignored if wait_obj is not FI_WAIT_SET.
.SS fi_close
.PP
The fi_close call releases all resources associated with a completion
queue.
Any completions which remain on the CQ when it is closed are lost.
.PP
When closing the CQ, there must be no opened endpoints, transmit
contexts, or receive contexts associated with the CQ.
If resources are still associated with the CQ when attempting to close,
the call will return \-FI_EBUSY.
.SS fi_control
.PP
The fi_control call is used to access provider or implementation
specific details of the completion queue.
Access to the CQ should be serialized across all calls when fi_control
is invoked, as it may redirect the implementation of CQ operations.
The following control commands are usable with a CQ.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_GETWAIT (void **)\f[R]
This command allows the user to retrieve the low\-level wait object
associated with the CQ.
The format of the wait\-object is specified during CQ creation, through
the CQ attributes.
The fi_control arg parameter should be an address where a pointer to the
returned wait object will be written.
See fi_eq.3 for addition details using fi_control with FI_GETWAIT.
.SS fi_cq_read
.PP
The fi_cq_read operation performs a non\-blocking read of completion
data from the CQ.
The format of the completion event is determined using the fi_cq_format
option that was specified when the CQ was opened.
Multiple completions may be retrieved from a CQ in a single call.
The maximum number of entries to return is limited to the specified
count parameter, with the number of entries successfully read from the
CQ returned by the call.
(See return values section below.)
.PP
CQs are optimized to report operations which have completed
successfully.
Operations which fail are reported `out of band'.
Such operations are retrieved using the fi_cq_readerr function.
When an operation that has completed with an unexpected error is
encountered, it is placed into a temporary error queue.
Attempting to read from a CQ while an item is in the error queue results
in fi_cq_read failing with a return code of \-FI_EAVAIL.
Applications may use this return code to determine when to call
fi_cq_readerr.
.SS fi_cq_readfrom
.PP
The fi_cq_readfrom call behaves identical to fi_cq_read, with the
exception that it allows the CQ to return source address information to
the user for any received data.
Source address data is only available for those endpoints configured
with FI_SOURCE capability.
If fi_cq_readfrom is called on an endpoint for which source addressing
data is not available, the source address will be set to
FI_ADDR_NOTAVAIL.
The number of input src_addr entries must be the same as the count
parameter.
.PP
Returned source addressing data is converted from the native address
used by the underlying fabric into an fi_addr_t, which may be used in
transmit operations.
Under most circumstances, returning fi_addr_t requires that the source
address already have been inserted into the address vector associated
with the receiving endpoint.
This is true for address vectors of type FI_AV_TABLE.
In select providers when FI_AV_MAP is used, source addresses may be
converted algorithmically into a usable fi_addr_t, even though the
source address has not been inserted into the address vector.
This is permitted by the API, as it allows the provider to avoid address
look\-up as part of receive message processing.
In no case do providers insert addresses into an AV separate from an
application calling fi_av_insert or similar call.
.PP
For endpoints allocated using the FI_SOURCE_ERR capability, if the
source address cannot be converted into a valid fi_addr_t value,
fi_cq_readfrom will return \-FI_EAVAIL, even if the data were received
successfully.
The completion will then be reported through fi_cq_readerr with error
code \-FI_EADDRNOTAVAIL.
See fi_cq_readerr for details.
.PP
If FI_SOURCE is specified without FI_SOURCE_ERR, source addresses which
cannot be mapped to a usable fi_addr_t will be reported as
FI_ADDR_NOTAVAIL.
.SS fi_cq_sread / fi_cq_sreadfrom
.PP
The fi_cq_sread and fi_cq_sreadfrom calls are the blocking equivalent
operations to fi_cq_read and fi_cq_readfrom.
Their behavior is similar to the non\-blocking calls, with the exception
that the calls will not return until either a completion has been read
from the CQ or an error or timeout occurs.
.PP
Threads blocking in this function will return to the caller if they are
signaled by some external source.
This is true even if the timeout has not occurred or was specified as
infinite.
.PP
It is invalid for applications to call these functions if the CQ has
been configured with a wait object of FI_WAIT_NONE or FI_WAIT_SET.
.SS fi_cq_readerr
.PP
The read error function, fi_cq_readerr, retrieves information regarding
any asynchronous operation which has completed with an unexpected error.
fi_cq_readerr is a non\-blocking call, returning immediately whether an
error completion was found or not.
.PP
Error information is reported to the user through
\f[C]struct fi_cq_err_entry\f[R].
The format of this structure is defined below.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
struct fi_cq_err_entry {
    void     *op_context; /* operation context */
    uint64_t flags;       /* completion flags */
    size_t   len;         /* size of received data */
    void     *buf;        /* receive data buffer */
    uint64_t data;        /* completion data */
    uint64_t tag;         /* message tag */
    size_t   olen;        /* overflow length */
    int      err;         /* positive error code */
    int      prov_errno;  /* provider error code */
    void    *err_data;    /*  error data */
    size_t   err_data_size; /* size of err_data */
};
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The general reason for the error is provided through the err field.
Provider specific error information may also be available through the
prov_errno and err_data fields.
Users may call fi_cq_strerror to convert provider specific error
information into a printable string for debugging purposes.
See field details below for more information on the use of err_data and
err_data_size.
.PP
Note that error completions are generated for all operations, including
those for which a completion was not requested (e.g.\ an endpoint is
configured with FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION, but the request did not have
the FI_COMPLETION flag set).
In such cases, providers will return as much information as made
available by the underlying software and hardware about the failure,
other fields will be set to NULL or 0.
This includes the op_context value, which may not have been provided or
was ignored on input as part of the transfer.
.PP
Notable completion error codes are given below.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_EADDRNOTAVAIL\f[R]
This error code is used by CQs configured with FI_SOURCE_ERR to report
completions for which a usable fi_addr_t source address could not be
found.
An error code of FI_EADDRNOTAVAIL indicates that the data transfer was
successfully received and processed, with the fi_cq_err_entry fields
containing information about the completion.
The err_data field will be set to the source address data.
The source address will be in the same format as specified through the
fi_info addr_format field for the opened domain.
This may be passed directly into an fi_av_insert call to add the source
address to the address vector.
.SS fi_cq_signal
.PP
The fi_cq_signal call will unblock any thread waiting in fi_cq_sread or
fi_cq_sreadfrom.
This may be used to wake\-up a thread that is blocked waiting to read a
completion operation.
The fi_cq_signal operation is only available if the CQ was configured
with a wait object.
.SH COMPLETION FIELDS
.PP
The CQ entry data structures share many of the same fields.
The meanings of these fields are the same for all CQ entry structure
formats.
.TP
.B \f[I]op_context\f[R]
The operation context is the application specified context value that
was provided with an asynchronous operation.
The op_context field is valid for all completions that are associated
with an asynchronous operation.
.PP
For completion events that are not associated with a posted operation,
this field will be set to NULL.
This includes completions generated at the target in response to RMA
write operations that carry CQ data (FI_REMOTE_WRITE | FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA
flags set), when the FI_RX_CQ_DATA mode bit is not required.
.TP
.B \f[I]flags\f[R]
This specifies flags associated with the completed operation.
The \f[I]Completion Flags\f[R] section below lists valid flag values.
Flags are set for all relevant completions.
.TP
.B \f[I]len\f[R]
This len field only applies to completed receive operations
(e.g.\ fi_recv, fi_trecv, etc.).
It indicates the size of received \f[I]message\f[R] data \[en] i.e.\ how
many data bytes were placed into the associated receive buffer by a
corresponding fi_send/fi_tsend/et al call.
If an endpoint has been configured with the FI_MSG_PREFIX mode, the len
also reflects the size of the prefix buffer.
.TP
.B \f[I]buf\f[R]
The buf field is only valid for completed receive operations, and only
applies when the receive buffer was posted with the FI_MULTI_RECV flag.
In this case, buf points to the starting location where the receive data
was placed.
.TP
.B \f[I]data\f[R]
The data field is only valid if the FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA completion flag is
set, and only applies to receive completions.
If FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA is set, this field will contain the completion data
provided by the peer as part of their transmit request.
The completion data will be given in host byte order.
.TP
.B \f[I]tag\f[R]
A tag applies only to received messages that occur using the tagged
interfaces.
This field contains the tag that was included with the received message.
The tag will be in host byte order.
.TP
.B \f[I]olen\f[R]
The olen field applies to received messages.
It is used to indicate that a received message has overrun the available
buffer space and has been truncated.
The olen specifies the amount of data that did not fit into the
available receive buffer and was discarded.
.TP
.B \f[I]err\f[R]
This err code is a positive fabric errno associated with a completion.
The err value indicates the general reason for an error, if one
occurred.
See fi_errno.3 for a list of possible error codes.
.TP
.B \f[I]prov_errno\f[R]
On an error, prov_errno may contain a provider specific error code.
The use of this field and its meaning is provider specific.
It is intended to be used as a debugging aid.
See fi_cq_strerror for additional details on converting this error value
into a human readable string.
.TP
.B \f[I]err_data\f[R]
The err_data field is used to return provider specific information, if
available, about the error.
On input, err_data should reference a data buffer of size err_data_size.
On output, the provider will fill in this buffer with any provider
specific data which may help identify the cause of the error.
The contents of the err_data field and its meaning is provider specific.
It is intended to be used as a debugging aid.
See fi_cq_strerror for additional details on converting this error data
into a human readable string.
See the compatibility note below on how this field is used for older
libfabric releases.
.TP
.B \f[I]err_data_size\f[R]
On input, err_data_size indicates the size of the err_data buffer in
bytes.
On output, err_data_size will be set to the number of bytes copied to
the err_data buffer.
The err_data information is typically used with fi_cq_strerror to
provide details about the type of error that occurred.
.PP
For compatibility purposes, the behavior of the err_data and
err_data_size fields is may be modified from that listed above.
If err_data_size is 0 on input, or the fabric was opened with release <
1.5, then any buffer referenced by err_data will be ignored on input.
In this situation, on output err_data will be set to a data buffer owned
by the provider.
The contents of the buffer will remain valid until a subsequent read
call against the CQ.
Applications must serialize access to the CQ when processing errors to
ensure that the buffer referenced by err_data does not change.
.SH COMPLETION FLAGS
.PP
Completion flags provide additional details regarding the completed
operation.
The following completion flags are defined.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_SEND\f[R]
Indicates that the completion was for a send operation.
This flag may be combined with an FI_MSG or FI_TAGGED flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_RECV\f[R]
Indicates that the completion was for a receive operation.
This flag may be combined with an FI_MSG or FI_TAGGED flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_RMA\f[R]
Indicates that an RMA operation completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_READ, FI_WRITE, FI_REMOTE_READ, or
FI_REMOTE_WRITE flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_ATOMIC\f[R]
Indicates that an atomic operation completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_READ, FI_WRITE, FI_REMOTE_READ, or
FI_REMOTE_WRITE flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R]
Indicates that a message\-based operation completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_SEND or FI_RECV flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[R]
Indicates that a tagged message operation completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_SEND or FI_RECV flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MULTICAST\f[R]
Indicates that a multicast operation completed.
This flag may be combined with FI_MSG and relevant flags.
This flag is only guaranteed to be valid for received messages if the
endpoint has been configured with FI_SOURCE.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_READ\f[R]
Indicates that a locally initiated RMA or atomic read operation has
completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_RMA or FI_ATOMIC flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_WRITE\f[R]
Indicates that a locally initiated RMA or atomic write operation has
completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_RMA or FI_ATOMIC flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_REMOTE_READ\f[R]
Indicates that a remotely initiated RMA or atomic read operation has
completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_RMA or FI_ATOMIC flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_REMOTE_WRITE\f[R]
Indicates that a remotely initiated RMA or atomic write operation has
completed.
This flag may be combined with an FI_RMA or FI_ATOMIC flag.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA\f[R]
This indicates that remote CQ data is available as part of the
completion.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MULTI_RECV\f[R]
This flag applies to receive buffers that were posted with the
FI_MULTI_RECV flag set.
This completion flag indicates that the original receive buffer
referenced by the completion has been consumed and was released by the
provider.
Providers may set this flag on the last message that is received into
the multi\- recv buffer, or may generate a separate completion that
indicates that the buffer has been released.
.PP
Applications can distinguish between these two cases by examining the
completion entry flags field.
If additional flags, such as FI_RECV, are set, the completion is
associated with a received message.
In this case, the buf field will reference the location where the
received message was placed into the multi\-recv buffer.
Other fields in the completion entry will be determined based on the
received message.
If other flag bits are zero, the provider is reporting that the
multi\-recv buffer has been released, and the completion entry is not
associated with a received message.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MORE\f[R]
See the `Buffered Receives' section in \f[C]fi_msg\f[R](3) for more
details.
This flag is associated with receive completions on endpoints that have
FI_BUFFERED_RECV mode enabled.
When set to one, it indicates that the buffer referenced by the
completion is limited by the FI_OPT_BUFFERED_LIMIT threshold, and
additional message data must be retrieved by the application using an
FI_CLAIM operation.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_CLAIM\f[R]
See the `Buffered Receives' section in \f[C]fi_msg\f[R](3) for more
details.
This flag is set on completions associated with receive operations that
claim buffered receive data.
Note that this flag only applies to endpoints configured with the
FI_BUFFERED_RECV mode bit.
.SH COMPLETION EVENT SEMANTICS
.PP
Libfabric defines several completion `levels', identified using
operational flags.
Each flag indicates the soonest that a completion event may be generated
by a provider, and the assumptions that an application may make upon
processing a completion.
The operational flags are defined below, along with an example of how a
provider might implement the semantic.
Note that only meeting the semantic is required of the provider and not
the implementation.
Providers may implement stronger completion semantics than necessary for
a given operation, but only the behavior defined by the completion level
is guaranteed.
.PP
To help understand the conceptual differences in completion levels,
consider mailing a letter.
Placing the letter into the local mailbox for pick\-up is similar to
`inject complete'.
Having the letter picked up and dropped off at the destination mailbox
is equivalent to `transmit complete'.
The `delivery complete' semantic is a stronger guarantee, with a person
at the destination signing for the letter.
However, the person who signed for the letter is not necessarily the
intended recipient.
The `match complete' option is similar to delivery complete, but
requires the intended recipient to sign for the letter.
.PP
The `commit complete' level has different semantics than the previously
mentioned levels.
Commit complete would be closer to the letter arriving at the
destination and being placed into a fire proof safe.
.PP
The operational flags for the described completion levels are defined
below.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_INJECT_COMPLETE\f[R]
Indicates that a completion should be generated when the source
buffer(s) may be reused.
A completion guarantees that the buffers will not be read from again and
the application may reclaim them.
No other guarantees are made with respect to the state of the operation.
.PP
Example: A provider may generate this completion event after copying the
source buffer into a network buffer, either in host memory or on the
NIC.
An inject completion does not indicate that the data has been
transmitted onto the network, and a local error could occur after the
completion event has been generated that could prevent it from being
transmitted.
.PP
Inject complete allows for the fastest completion reporting (and, hence,
buffer reuse), but provides the weakest guarantees against network
errors.
.PP
Note: This flag is used to control when a completion entry is inserted
into a completion queue.
It does not apply to operations that do not generate a completion queue
entry, such as the fi_inject operation, and is not subject to the
inject_size message limit restriction.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE\f[R]
Indicates that a completion should be generated when the transmit
operation has completed relative to the local provider.
The exact behavior is dependent on the endpoint type.
.PP
For reliable endpoints:
.PP
Indicates that a completion should be generated when the operation has
been delivered to the peer endpoint.
A completion guarantees that the operation is no longer dependent on the
fabric or local resources.
The state of the operation at the peer endpoint is not defined.
.PP
Example: A provider may generate a transmit complete event upon
receiving an ack from the peer endpoint.
The state of the message at the peer is unknown and may be buffered in
the target NIC at the time the ack has been generated.
.PP
For unreliable endpoints:
.PP
Indicates that a completion should be generated when the operation has
been delivered to the fabric.
A completion guarantees that the operation is no longer dependent on
local resources.
The state of the operation within the fabric is not defined.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE\f[R]
Indicates that a completion should not be generated until an operation
has been processed by the destination endpoint(s).
A completion guarantees that the result of the operation is available;
however, additional steps may need to be taken at the destination to
retrieve the results.
For example, an application may need to provide a receive buffers in
order to retrieve messages that were buffered by the provider.
.PP
Delivery complete indicates that the message has been processed by the
peer.
If an application buffer was ready to receive the results of the message
when it arrived, then delivery complete indicates that the data was
placed into the application\[cq]s buffer.
.PP
This completion mode applies only to reliable endpoints.
For operations that return data to the initiator, such as RMA read or
atomic\-fetch, the source endpoint is also considered a destination
endpoint.
This is the default completion mode for such operations.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_MATCH_COMPLETE\f[R]
Indicates that a completion should be generated only after the operation
has been matched with an application specified buffer.
Operations using this completion semantic are dependent on the
application at the target claiming the message or results.
As a result, match complete may involve additional provider level
acknowledgements or lengthy delays.
However, this completion model enables peer applications to synchronize
their execution.
Many providers may not support this semantic.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_COMMIT_COMPLETE\f[R]
Indicates that a completion should not be generated (locally or at the
peer) until the result of an operation have been made persistent.
A completion guarantees that the result is both available and durable,
in the case of power failure.
.PP
This completion mode applies only to operations that target persistent
memory regions over reliable endpoints.
This completion mode is experimental.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_FENCE\f[R]
This is not a completion level, but plays a role in the completion
ordering between operations that would not normally be ordered.
An operation that is marked with the FI_FENCE flag and all operations
posted after the fenced operation are deferred until all previous
operations targeting the same peer endpoint have completed.
Additionally, the completion of the fenced operation indicates that
prior operations have met the same completion level as the fenced
operation.
For example, if an operation is posted as FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE |
FI_FENCE, then its completion indicates prior operations have met the
semantic required for FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE.
This is true even if the prior operation was posted with a lower
completion level, such as FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE or FI_INJECT_COMPLETE.
.PP
Note that a completion generated for an operation posted prior to the
fenced operation only guarantees that the completion level that was
originally requested has been met.
It is the completion of the fenced operation that guarantees that the
additional semantics have been met.
.PP
The above completion semantics are defined with respect to the initiator
of the operation.
The different semantics are useful for describing when the initiator may
re\-use a data buffer, and guarantees what state a transfer must reach
prior to a completion being generated.
This allows applications to determine appropriate error handling in case
of communication failures.
.SH TARGET COMPLETION SEMANTICS
.PP
The completion semantic at the target is used to determine when data at
the target is visible to the peer application.
Visibility indicates that a memory read to the same address that was the
target of a data transfer will return the results of the transfer.
The target of a transfer can be identified by the initiator, as may be
the case for RMA and atomic operations, or determined by the target, for
example by providing a matching receive buffer.
Global visibility indicates that the results are available regardless of
where the memory read originates.
For example, the read could come from a process running on a host CPU,
it may be accessed by subsequent data transfer over the fabric, or read
from a peer device such as a GPU.
.PP
In terms of completion semantics, visibility usually indicates that the
transfer meets the FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE requirements from the
perspective of the target.
The target completion semantic may be, but is not necessarily, linked
with the completion semantic specified by the initiator of the transfer.
.PP
Often, target processes do not explicitly state a desired completion
semantic and instead rely on the default semantic.
The default behavior is based on several factors, including:
.IP \[bu] 2
whether a completion even is generated at the target
.IP \[bu] 2
the type of transfer involved (e.g.\ msg vs RMA)
.IP \[bu] 2
endpoint data and message ordering guarantees
.IP \[bu] 2
properties of the targeted memory buffer
.IP \[bu] 2
the initiator\[cq]s specified completion semantic
.PP
Broadly, target completion semantics are grouped based on whether or not
the transfer generates a completion event at the target.
This includes writing a CQ entry or updating a completion counter.
In common use cases, transfers that use a message interface (FI_MSG or
FI_TAGGED) typically generate target events, while transfers involving
an RMA interface (FI_RMA or FI_ATOMIC) often do not.
There are exceptions to both these cases, depending on endpoint to CQ
and counter bindings and operational flags.
For example, RMA writes that carry remote CQ data will generate a
completion event at the target, and are frequently used to convey
visibility to the target application.
The general guidelines for target side semantics are described below,
followed by exceptions that modify that behavior.
.PP
By default, completions generated at the target indicate that the
transferred data is immediately available to be read from the target
buffer.
That is, the target sees FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE (or better) semantics,
even if the initiator requested lower semantics.
For applications using only data buffers allocated from host memory,
this is often sufficient.
.PP
For operations that do not generate a completion event at the target,
the visibility of the data at the target may need to be inferred based
on subsequent operations that do generate target completions.
Absent a target completion, when a completion of an operation is written
at the initiator, the visibility semantic of the operation at the target
aligns with the initiator completion semantic.
For instance, if an RMA operation completes at the initiator as either
FI_INJECT_COMPLETE or FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE, the data visibility at the
target is not guaranteed.
.PP
One or more of the following mechanisms can be used by the target
process to guarantee that the results of a data transfer that did not
generate a completion at the target is now visible.
This list is not inclusive of all options, but defines common uses.
In the descriptions below, the first transfer does not result in a
completion event at the target, but is eventually followed by a transfer
which does.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the endpoint guarantees message ordering between two transfers, the
target completion of a second transfer will indicate that the data from
the first transfer is available.
For example, if the endpoint supports send after write ordering
(FI_ORDER_SAW), then a receive completion corresponding to the send will
indicate that the write data is available.
This holds independent of the initiator\[cq]s completion semantic for
either the write or send.
When ordering is guaranteed, the second transfer can be queued with the
provider immediately after queuing the first.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the endpoint does not guarantee message ordering, the initiator must
take additional steps to ensure visibility.
If initiator requests FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE semantics for the first
operation, the initiator can wait for the operation to complete locally.
Once the completion has been read, the target completion of a second
transfer will indicate that the first transfer\[cq]s data is visible.
.IP \[bu] 2
Alternatively, if message ordering is not guaranteed by the endpoint,
the initiator can use the FI_FENCE and FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE flags on the
second data transfer to force the first transfers to meet the
FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE semantics.
If the second transfer generates a completion at the target, that will
indicate that the data is visible.
Otherwise, a target completion for any transfer after the fenced
operation will indicate that the data is visible.
.PP
The above semantics apply for transfers targeting traditional host
memory buffers.
However, the behavior may differ when device memory and/or persistent
memory is involved (FI_HMEM and FI_PMEM capability bits).
When heterogenous memory is involved, the concept of memory domains come
into play.
Memory domains identify the physical separation of memory, which may or
may not be accessible through the same virtual address space.
See the \f[C]fi_mr\f[R](3) man page for further details on memory
domains.
.PP
Completion ordering and data visibility are only well\-defined for
transfers that target the same memory domain.
Applications need to be aware of ordering and visibility differences
when transfers target different memory domains.
Additionally, applications also need to be concerned with the memory
domain that completions themselves are written and if it differs from
the memory domain targeted by a transfer.
In some situations, either the provider or application may need to call
device specific APIs to synchronize or flush device memory caches in
order to achieve the desired data visibility.
.PP
When heterogenous memory is in use, the default target completion
semantic for transfers that generate a completion at the target is still
FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE, however, applications should be aware that there
may be a negative impact on overall performance for providers to meet
this requirement.
.PP
For example, a target process may be using a GPU to accelerate
computations.
A memory region mapping to memory on the GPU may be exposed to peers as
either an RMA target or posted locally as a receive buffer.
In this case, the application is concerned with two memory domains \[en]
system and GPU memory.
Completions are written to system memory.
.PP
Continuing the example, a peer process sends a tagged message.
That message is matched with the receive buffer located in GPU memory.
The NIC copies the data from the network into the receive buffer and
writes an entry into the completion queue.
Note that both memory domains were accessed as part of this transfer.
The message data was directed to the GPU memory, but the completion went
to host memory.
Because separate memory domains may not be synchronized with each other,
it is possible for the host CPU to see and process the completion entry
before the transfer to the GPU memory is visible to either the host GPU
or even software running on the GPU.
From the perspective of the \f[I]provider\f[R], visibility of the
completion does not imply visibility of data written to the GPU\[cq]s
memory domain.
.PP
The default completion semantic at the target \f[I]application\f[R] for
message operations is FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE.
An anticipated provider implementation in this situation is for the
provider software running on the host CPU to intercept the CQ entry,
detect that the data landed in heterogenous memory, and perform the
necessary device synchronization or flush operation before reporting the
completion up to the application.
This ensures that the data is visible to CPU \f[I]and\f[R] GPU software
prior to the application processing the completion.
.PP
In addition to the cost of provider software intercepting completions
and checking if a transfer targeted heterogenous memory, device
synchronization itself may impact performance.
As a result, applications can request a lower completion semantic when
posting receives.
That indicates to the provider that the application will be responsible
for handling any device specific flush operations that might be needed.
See \f[C]fi_msg\f[R](3) FLAGS.
.PP
For data transfers that do not generate a completion at the target, such
as RMA or atomics, it is the responsibility of the application to ensure
that all target buffers meet the necessary visibility requirements of
the application.
The previously mentioned bulleted methods for notifying the target that
the data is visible may not be sufficient, as the provider software at
the target could lack the context needed to ensure visibility.
This implies that the application may need to call device
synchronization/flush APIs directly.
.PP
For example, a peer application could perform several RMA writes that
target GPU memory buffers.
If the provider offloads RMA operations into the NIC, the provider
software at the target will be unaware that the RMA operations have
occurred.
If the peer sends a message to the target application that indicates
that the RMA operations are done, the application must ensure that the
RMA data is visible to the host CPU or GPU prior to executing code that
accesses the data.
The target completion of having received the sent message is not
sufficient, even if send\-after\-write ordering is supported.
.PP
Most target heterogenous memory completion semantics map to
FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE or FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE.
Persistent memory (FI_PMEM capability), however, is often used with
FI_COMMIT_COMPLETE semantics.
Heterogenous completion concepts still apply.
.PP
For transfers flagged by the initiator with FI_COMMIT_COMPLETE, a
completion at the target indicates that the results are visible and
durable.
For transfers targeting persistent memory, but using a different
completion semantic at the initiator, the visibility at the target is
similar to that described above.
Durability is only associated with transfers marked with
FI_COMMIT_COMPLETE.
.PP
For transfers targeting persistent memory that request
FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE, then a completion, at either the initiator or
target, indicates that the data is visible.
Visibility at the target can be conveyed using one of the above describe
mechanism \[en] generating a target completion, sending a message from
the initiator, etc.
Similarly, if the initiator requested FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE, then
additional steps are needed to ensure visibility at the target.
For example, the transfer can generate a completion at the target, which
would indicate visibility, but not durability.
The initiator can also follow the transfer with another operation that
forces visibility, such as using FI_FENCE in conjunction with
FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE.
.SH NOTES
.PP
A completion queue must be bound to at least one enabled endpoint before
any operation such as fi_cq_read, fi_cq_readfrom, fi_cq_sread,
fi_cq_sreadfrom etc.
can be called on it.
.PP
Completion flags may be suppressed if the FI_NOTIFY_FLAGS_ONLY mode bit
has been set.
When enabled, only the following flags are guaranteed to be set in
completion data when they are valid: FI_REMOTE_READ and FI_REMOTE_WRITE
(when FI_RMA_EVENT capability bit has been set), FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA, and
FI_MULTI_RECV.
.PP
If a completion queue has been overrun, it will be placed into an
`overrun' state.
Read operations will continue to return any valid, non\-corrupted
completions, if available.
After all valid completions have been retrieved, any attempt to read the
CQ will result in it returning an FI_EOVERRUN error event.
Overrun completion queues are considered fatal and may not be used to
report additional completions once the overrun occurs.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.TP
.B fi_cq_open / fi_cq_signal
Returns 0 on success.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
.PP
fi_cq_read / fi_cq_readfrom / fi_cq_readerr fi_cq_sread /
fi_cq_sreadfrom : On success, returns the number of completion events
retrieved from the completion queue.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
If no completions are available to return from the CQ, \-FI_EAGAIN will
be returned.
.TP
.B fi_cq_sread / fi_cq_sreadfrom
On success, returns the number of completion events retrieved from the
completion queue.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
If the timeout expires or the calling thread is signaled and no data is
available to be read from the completion queue, \-FI_EAGAIN is returned.
.TP
.B fi_cq_strerror
Returns a character string interpretation of the provider specific error
returned with a completion.
.PP
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[R].
