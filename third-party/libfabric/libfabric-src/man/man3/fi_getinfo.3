.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\f[I]version\f[R]
Interface version requested by application.
.TP
\f[I]node\f[R]
Optional, name or fabric address to resolve.
.TP
\f[I]service\f[R]
Optional, service name or port number of address.
.TP
\f[I]flags\f[R]
Operation flags for the fi_getinfo call.
.TP
\f[I]hints\f[R]
Reference to an fi_info structure that specifies criteria for selecting
the returned fabric information.
.TP
\f[I]info\f[R]
A pointer to a linked list of fi_info structures containing response
information.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
fi_getinfo returns information about available fabric services for
reaching specified node or service, subject to any provided hints.
Callers may specify NULL for node, service, and hints in order to
retrieve information about what providers are available and their
optimal usage models.
If no matching fabric information is available, info will be set to NULL
and the call will return -FI_ENODATA.
.PP
Based on the input hints, node, and service parameters, a list of fabric
domains and endpoints will be returned.
Each fi_info structure will describe an endpoint that meets the
application\[cq]s specified communication criteria.
Each endpoint will be associated with a domain.
Applications can restrict the number of returned endpoints by including
additional criteria in their search hints.
Relaxing or eliminating input hints will increase the number and type of
endpoints that are available.
Providers that return multiple endpoints to a single fi_getinfo call
should return the endpoints that are highest performing first.
Providers may indicate that an endpoint and domain can support
additional capabilities than those requested by the user only if such
support will not adversely affect application performance or security.
.PP
The version parameter is used by the application to request the desired
version of the interfaces.
The version determines the format of all data structures used by any of
the fabric interfaces.
Applications should use the FI_VERSION(major, minor) macro to indicate
the version, with hard-coded integer values for the major and minor
values.
The FI_MAJOR_VERSION and FI_MINOR_VERSION enum values defined in
fabric.h specify the latest version of the installed library.
However, it is recommended that the integer values for FI_MAJOR_VERSION
and FI_MINOR_VERSION be used, rather than referencing the enum types in
order to ensure compatibility with future versions of the library.
This protects against the application being built from source against a
newer version of the library that introduces new fields to data
structures, which would not be initialized by the application.
.PP
Node, service, or hints may be provided, with any combination being
supported.
If node is provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric
address to the given node.
If node is not given, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric
addressing information based on the provided hints.
Node is commonly used to provide a network address (such as an IP
address) or hostname.
Service is usually associated with a transport address (such as a TCP
port number).
Node and service parameters may be mapped by providers to native fabric
addresses.
Applications may also pass in an FI_ADDR_STR formatted address (see
format details below) as the node parameter.
In such cases, the service parameter must be NULL.
.PP
The hints parameter, if provided, may be used to limit the resulting
output as indicated below.
As a general rule, specifying a non-zero value for input hints indicates
that a provider must support the requested value or fail the operation
with -FI_ENODATA.
With the exception of mode bits, hints that are set to zero are treated
as a wildcard.
A zeroed hint value results in providers either returning a default
value or a value that works best for their implementation.
Mode bits that are set to zero indicate the application does not support
any modes.
.PP
The caller must call fi_freeinfo to release fi_info structures returned
by this call.
.PP
The fi_allocinfo call will allocate and zero an fi_info structure and
all related substructures.
The fi_dupinfo will duplicate a single fi_info structure and all the
substructures within it.

Indicates the length of the source address.
This value must be > 0 if \f[I]src_addr\f[R] is non-NULL.
This field will be ignored in hints if FI_SOURCE flag is set, or
\f[I]src_addr\f[R] is NULL.
.TP
\f[I]dest_addrlen - destination address length\f[R]
Indicates the length of the destination address.
This value must be > 0 if \f[I]dest_addr\f[R] is non-NULL.

If specified, indicates the source address.
This field will be ignored in hints if FI_SOURCE flag is set.
On output a provider shall return an address that corresponds to the
indicated fabric, domain, node, and/or service fields.
The format of the address is indicated by the returned
\f[I]addr_format\f[R] field.
Note that any returned address is only used when opening a local
endpoint.
The address is not guaranteed to be usable by a peer process.
.TP
\f[I]dest_addr - destination address\f[R]
If specified, indicates the destination address.
This field will be ignored in hints unless the node and service
parameters are NULL or FI_SOURCE flag is set.
If FI_SOURCE is not specified, on output a provider shall return an
address the corresponds to the indicated node and/or service fields,
relative to the fabric and domain.
Note that any returned address is only usable locally.
.TP
\f[I]handle - provider context handle\f[R]
The use of this field is operation specific.
If hints->handle is set to struct fid_pep, the hints->handle will be
copied to info->handle on output from fi_getinfo.
Other values of hints->handle will be handled in a provider specific
manner.
The fi_info::handle field is also used by fi_endpoint() and fi_reject()
calls when processing connection requests or to inherit another
endpoint\[cq]s attributes.
See \f[C]fi_eq\f[R](3), \f[C]fi_reject\f[R](3), and
\f[C]fi_endpoint\f[R](3).
The info->handle field will be ignored by fi_dupinfo and fi_freeinfo.
.TP

returned.
Output values will be greater than or equal to requested input values.
See \f[C]fi_domain\f[R](3) for details.
.TP
\f[I]fabric_attr - fabric attributes\f[R]
Optionally supplied fabric attributes.
Fabric attributes may be specified and returned as part of fi_getinfo.
When provided as hints, requested values of struct fi_fabric_attr should
be set.
On output, the actual fabric attributes that can be provided will be
returned.
See \f[C]fi_fabric\f[R](3) for details.
.TP
\f[I]nic - network interface details\f[R]
Optional attributes related to the hardware NIC associated with the
specified fabric, domain, and endpoint data.
This field is only valid for providers where the corresponding
attributes are closely associated with a hardware NIC.
See \f[C]fi_nic\f[R](3) for details.
.SH CAPABILITIES
.PP
Interface capabilities are obtained by OR-ing the following flags
together.
If capabilities in the hint parameter are set to 0, the underlying
provider will return the set of capabilities which are supported.
Otherwise, providers will return data matching the specified set of
capabilities.
Providers may indicate support for additional capabilities beyond those
requested when the use of expanded capabilities will not adversely
affect performance or expose the application to communication beyond
that which was requested.
Applications may use this feature to request a minimal set of
requirements, then check the returned capabilities to enable additional
optimizations.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ATOMIC\f[R]
Specifies that the endpoint supports some set of atomic operations.
Endpoints supporting this capability support operations defined by
struct fi_ops_atomic.
In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_ATOMIC implies the ability to
initiate and be the target of remote atomic reads and writes.
Applications can use the FI_READ, FI_WRITE, FI_REMOTE_READ, and
FI_REMOTE_WRITE flags to restrict the types of atomic operations
supported by an endpoint.
.TP
\f[I]FI_AV_USER_ID\f[R]
Requests that the provider support the association of a user specified
identifier with each address vector (AV) address.
User identifiers are returned with completion data in place of the AV
address.
See [\f[C]fi_av\f[R](3)] (fi_av.3.html) for more details.
.TP
\f[I]FI_COLLECTIVE\f[R]
Requests support for collective operations.
Endpoints that support this capability support the collective operations
defined in \f[C]fi_collective\f[R](3).
.TP
\f[I]FI_DIRECTED_RECV\f[R]
Requests that the communication endpoint use the source address of an
incoming message when matching it with a receive buffer.
If this capability is not set, then the src_addr parameter for msg and
tagged receive operations is ignored.
.TP
\f[I]FI_FENCE\f[R]
Indicates that the endpoint support the FI_FENCE flag on data transfer
operations.
Support requires tracking that all previous transmit requests to a
specified remote endpoint complete prior to initiating the fenced
operation.
Fenced operations are often used to enforce ordering between operations
that are not otherwise guaranteed by the underlying provider or
protocol.
.TP
\f[I]FI_HMEM\f[R]
Specifies that the endpoint should support transfers to and from device
memory.
.TP
\f[I]FI_LOCAL_COMM\f[R]
Indicates that the endpoint support host local communication.
This flag may be used in conjunction with FI_REMOTE_COMM to indicate
that local and remote communication are required.
If neither FI_LOCAL_COMM or FI_REMOTE_COMM are specified, then the
provider will indicate support for the configuration that minimally
affects performance.
Providers that set FI_LOCAL_COMM but not FI_REMOTE_COMM, for example a
shared memory provider, may only be used to communication between
processes on the same system.
.TP
\f[I]FI_MSG\f[R]
Specifies that an endpoint should support sending and receiving messages
or datagrams.
Message capabilities imply support for send and/or receive queues.
Endpoints supporting this capability support operations defined by
struct fi_ops_msg.
.PP
The caps may be used to specify or restrict the type of messaging
operations that are supported.
In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_MSG implies the ability to send
and receive messages.
Applications can use the FI_SEND and FI_RECV flags to optimize an
endpoint as send-only or receive-only.
.TP
\f[I]FI_MULTICAST\f[R]
Indicates that the endpoint support multicast data transfers.
This capability must be paired with FI_MSG.
Applications can use FI_SEND and FI_RECV to optimize multicast as
send-only or receive-only.
.TP
\f[I]FI_MULTI_RECV\f[R]
Specifies that the endpoint must support the FI_MULTI_RECV flag when
posting receive buffers.
.TP
\f[I]FI_NAMED_RX_CTX\f[R]
Requests that endpoints which support multiple receive contexts allow an
initiator to target (or name) a specific receive context as part of a
data transfer operation.
.TP
\f[I]FI_READ\f[R]
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of initiating reads
against remote memory regions.
This flag requires that FI_RMA and/or FI_ATOMIC be set.
.TP
\f[I]FI_RECV\f[R]
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of receiving
message data transfers.
Message transfers include base message operations as well as tagged
message functionality.
.TP
\f[I]FI_REMOTE_COMM\f[R]
Indicates that the endpoint support communication with endpoints located
at remote nodes (across the fabric).
See FI_LOCAL_COMM for additional details.
Providers that set FI_REMOTE_COMM but not FI_LOCAL_COMM, for example
NICs that lack loopback support, cannot be used to communicate with
processes on the same system.
.TP
\f[I]FI_REMOTE_READ\f[R]
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of receiving read
memory operations from remote endpoints.
This flag requires that FI_RMA and/or FI_ATOMIC be set.
.TP
\f[I]FI_REMOTE_WRITE\f[R]
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of receiving write
memory operations from remote endpoints.
This flag requires that FI_RMA and/or FI_ATOMIC be set.
.TP
\f[I]FI_RMA\f[R]
Specifies that the endpoint should support RMA read and write
operations.
Endpoints supporting this capability support operations defined by
struct fi_ops_rma.
In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_RMA implies the ability to
initiate and be the target of remote memory reads and writes.
Applications can use the FI_READ, FI_WRITE, FI_REMOTE_READ, and
FI_REMOTE_WRITE flags to restrict the types of RMA operations supported
by an endpoint.
.TP
\f[I]FI_RMA_EVENT\f[R]
Requests that an endpoint support the generation of completion events
when it is the target of an RMA and/or atomic operation.
This flag requires that FI_REMOTE_READ and/or FI_REMOTE_WRITE be enabled
on the endpoint.
.TP
\f[I]FI_RMA_PMEM\f[R]
Indicates that the provider is `persistent memory aware' and supports
RMA operations to and from persistent memory.
Persistent memory aware providers must support registration of memory
that is backed by non- volatile memory, RMA transfers to/from persistent
memory, and enhanced completion semantics.
This flag requires that FI_RMA be set.
This capability is experimental.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SEND\f[R]
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of sending message
data transfers.
Message transfers include base message operations as well as tagged
message functionality.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SHARED_AV\f[R]
Requests or indicates support for address vectors which may be shared
among multiple processes.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOURCE\f[R]
Requests that the endpoint return source addressing data as part of its
completion data.
This capability only applies to connectionless endpoints.
Note that returning source address information may require that the
provider perform address translation and/or look-up based on data
available in the underlying protocol in order to provide the requested
data, which may adversely affect performance.
The performance impact may be greater for address vectors of type
FI_AV_TABLE.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOURCE_ERR\f[R]
Must be paired with FI_SOURCE.
When specified, this requests that raw source addressing data be
returned as part of completion data for any address that has not been
inserted into the local address vector.
Use of this capability may require the provider to validate incoming
source address data against addresses stored in the local address
vector, which may adversely affect performance.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[R]
Specifies that the endpoint should handle tagged message transfers.
Tagged message transfers associate a user-specified key or tag with each
message that is used for matching purposes at the remote side.
Endpoints supporting this capability support operations defined by
struct fi_ops_tagged.
In the absence of any relevant flags, FI_TAGGED implies the ability to
send and receive tagged messages.
Applications can use the FI_SEND and FI_RECV flags to optimize an
endpoint as send-only or receive-only.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TRIGGER\f[R]
Indicates that the endpoint should support triggered operations.
Endpoints support this capability must meet the usage model as described
by \f[C]fi_trigger\f[R](3).
.TP
\f[I]FI_VARIABLE_MSG\f[R]
Requests that the provider must notify a receiver when a variable length
message is ready to be received prior to attempting to place the data.
Such notification will include the size of the message and any
associated message tag (for FI_TAGGED).
See `Variable Length Messages' in fi_msg.3 for full details.
Variable length messages are any messages larger than an endpoint
configurable size.
This flag requires that FI_MSG and/or FI_TAGGED be set.
.TP
\f[I]FI_WRITE\f[R]
Indicates that the user requires an endpoint capable of initiating
writes against remote memory regions.
This flag requires that FI_RMA and/or FI_ATOMIC be set.
.TP
\f[I]FI_XPU\f[R]
Specifies that the endpoint should support transfers that may be
initiated from heterogenous computation devices, such as GPUs.
This flag requires that FI_TRIGGER be set.
For additional details on XPU triggers see \f[C]fi_trigger\f[R](3).
.PP
Capabilities may be grouped into three general categories: primary,
secondary, and primary modifiers.
Primary capabilities must explicitly be requested by an application, and
a provider must enable support for only those primary capabilities which
were selected.
Primary modifiers are used to limit a primary capability, such as
restricting an endpoint to being send-only.
If no modifiers are specified for an applicable capability, all relevant
modifiers are assumed.
See above definitions for details.
.PP
Secondary capabilities may optionally be requested by an application.
If requested, a provider must support the capability or fail the
fi_getinfo request (FI_ENODATA).
A provider may optionally report non-selected secondary capabilities if
doing so would not compromise performance or security.
.PP
Primary capabilities: FI_MSG, FI_RMA, FI_TAGGED, FI_ATOMIC,
FI_MULTICAST, FI_NAMED_RX_CTX, FI_DIRECTED_RECV, FI_VARIABLE_MSG,
FI_HMEM, FI_COLLECTIVE, FI_XPU
.PP
Primary modifiers: FI_READ, FI_WRITE, FI_RECV, FI_SEND, FI_REMOTE_READ,
FI_REMOTE_WRITE
.PP
Secondary capabilities: FI_MULTI_RECV, FI_SOURCE, FI_RMA_EVENT,
FI_SHARED_AV, FI_TRIGGER, FI_FENCE, FI_LOCAL_COMM, FI_REMOTE_COMM,
FI_SOURCE_ERR, FI_RMA_PMEM.
.SH MODE
.PP
The operational mode bits are used to convey requirements that an
application must adhere to when using the fabric interfaces.
Modes specify optimal ways of accessing the reported endpoint or domain.
Applications that are designed to support a specific mode of operation
may see improved performance when that mode is desired by the provider.
It is recommended that providers support applications that disable any
provider preferred modes.
.PP
On input to fi_getinfo, applications set the mode bits that they
support.
On output, providers will clear mode bits that are not necessary to
achieve high-performance.
Mode bits that remain set indicate application requirements for using
the fabric interfaces created using the returned fi_info.
The set of modes are listed below.
If a NULL hints structure is provided, then the provider\[cq]s supported
set of modes will be returned in the info structure(s).
.TP
\f[I]FI_ASYNC_IOV\f[R]
Applications can reference multiple data buffers as part of a single
operation through the use of IO vectors (SGEs).
Typically, the contents of an IO vector are copied by the provider into
an internal buffer area, or directly to the underlying hardware.
However, when a large number of IOV entries are supported, IOV buffering
may have a negative impact on performance and memory consumption.
The FI_ASYNC_IOV mode indicates that the application must provide the
buffering needed for the IO vectors.
When set, an application must not modify an IO vector of length > 1,
including any related memory descriptor array, until the associated
operation has completed.
.TP
\f[I]FI_BUFFERED_RECV\f[R]
The buffered receive mode bit indicates that the provider owns the data
buffer(s) that are accessed by the networking layer for received
messages.
Typically, this implies that data must be copied from the provider
buffer into the application buffer.
Applications that can handle message processing from network allocated
data buffers can set this mode bit to avoid copies.
For full details on application requirements to support this mode, see
the `Buffered Receives' section in \f[C]fi_msg\f[R](3).
This mode bit applies to FI_MSG and FI_TAGGED receive operations.
.TP
\f[I]FI_CONTEXT\f[R]
Specifies that the provider requires that applications use struct
fi_context as their per operation context parameter for operations that
generated full completions.
This structure should be treated as opaque to the application.
For performance reasons, this structure must be allocated by the user,
but may be used by the fabric provider to track the operation.
Typically, users embed struct fi_context within their own context
structure.
The struct fi_context must remain valid until the corresponding
operation completes or is successfully canceled.
As such, fi_context should NOT be allocated on the stack.
Doing so is likely to result in stack corruption that will be difficult
to debug.
Users should not update or interpret the fields in this structure, or
reuse it until the original operation has completed.
If an operation does not generate a completion (i.e.\ the endpoint was
configured with FI_SELECTIVE_COMPLETION and the operation was not
initiated with the FI_COMPLETION flag) then the context parameter is
ignored by the fabric provider.
The structure is specified in rdma/fabric.h.
.TP
\f[I]FI_CONTEXT2\f[R]
This bit is similar to FI_CONTEXT, but doubles the provider\[cq]s
requirement on the size of the per context structure.
When set, this specifies that the provider requires that applications
use struct fi_context2 as their per operation context parameter.
Or, optionally, an application can provide an array of two fi_context
structures (e.g.\ struct fi_context[2]) instead.
The requirements for using struct fi_context2 are identical as defined
for FI_CONTEXT above.
.TP
\f[I]FI_LOCAL_MR\f[R]
The provider is optimized around having applications register memory for
locally accessed data buffers.
Data buffers used in send and receive operations and as the source
buffer for RMA and atomic operations must be registered by the
application for access domains opened with this capability.
This flag is defined for compatibility and is ignored if the application
version is 1.5 or later and the domain mr_mode is set to anything other
than FI_MR_BASIC or FI_MR_SCALABLE.
See the domain attribute mr_mode \f[C]fi_domain\f[R](3) and
\f[C]fi_mr\f[R](3).
.TP
\f[I]FI_MSG_PREFIX\f[R]
Message prefix mode indicates that an application will provide buffer
space in front of all message send and receive buffers for use by the
provider.
Typically, the provider uses this space to implement a protocol, with
the protocol headers being written into the prefix area.
The contents of the prefix space should be treated as opaque.
The use of FI_MSG_PREFIX may improve application performance over
certain providers by reducing the number of IO vectors referenced by
underlying hardware and eliminating provider buffer allocation.
.PP
FI_MSG_PREFIX only applies to send and receive operations, including
tagged sends and receives.
RMA and atomics do not require the application to provide prefix
buffers.
Prefix buffer space must be provided with all sends and receives,
regardless of the size of the transfer or other transfer options.
The ownership of prefix buffers is treated the same as the corresponding
message buffers, but the size of the prefix buffer is not counted toward
any message limits, including inject.
.PP
Applications that support prefix mode must supply buffer space before
their own message data.
The size of space that must be provided is specified by the
msg_prefix_size endpoint attribute.
Providers are required to define a msg_prefix_size that is a multiple of
8 bytes.
Additionally, applications may receive provider generated packets that
do not contain application data.
Such received messages will indicate a transfer size of that is equal to
or smaller than msg_prefix_size.
.PP
The buffer pointer given to all send and receive operations must point
to the start of the prefix region of the buffer (as opposed to the
payload).
For scatter-gather send/recv operations, the prefix buffer must be a
contiguous region, though it may or may not be directly adjacent to the
payload portion of the buffer.
.TP
\f[I]FI_NOTIFY_FLAGS_ONLY\f[R]
This bit indicates that general completion flags may not be set by the
provider, and are not needed by the application.
If specified, completion flags which simply report the type of operation
that completed (e.g.\ send or receive) may not be set.
However, completion flags that are used for remote notifications will
still be set when applicable.
See \f[C]fi_cq\f[R](3) for details on which completion flags are valid
when this mode bit is enabled.
.TP
\f[I]FI_RESTRICTED_COMP\f[R]
This bit indicates that the application will only share completion
queues and counters among endpoints, transmit contexts, and receive
contexts that have the same set of capability flags.
.TP
\f[I]FI_RX_CQ_DATA\f[R]
This mode bit only applies to data transfers that set FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA.
When set, a data transfer that carries remote CQ data will consume a
receive buffer at the target.
This is true even for operations that would normally not consume posted
receive buffers, such as RMA write operations.
.SH ADDRESSING FORMATS
.PP
Multiple fabric interfaces take as input either a source or destination
address parameter.
This includes struct fi_info (src_addr and dest_addr), CM calls
(getname, getpeer, connect, join, and leave), and AV calls (insert,
lookup, and straddr).
The fi_info addr_format field indicates the expected address format for
these operations.
.PP
A provider may support one or more of the following addressing formats.
In some cases, a selected addressing format may need to be translated or
mapped into an address which is native to the fabric.
See \f[C]fi_av\f[R](3).
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_BGQ\f[R]
Address is an IBM proprietary format that is used with their Blue Gene Q
systems.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_EFA\f[R]
Address is an Amazon Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) proprietary format.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_GNI\f[R]
Address is a Cray proprietary format that is used with their GNI
protocol.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_PSMX\f[R]
Address is an Intel proprietary format used with their Performance
Scaled Messaging protocol.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_PSMX2\f[R]
Address is an Intel proprietary format used with their Performance
Scaled Messaging protocol version 2.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_PSMX3\f[R]
Address is an Intel proprietary format used with their Performance
Scaled Messaging protocol version 3.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_STR\f[R]
Address is a formatted character string.
The length and content of the string is address and/or provider
specific, but in general follows a URI model:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
address_format[://[node][:[service][/[field3]...][?[key=value][&k2=v2]...]]]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Examples: - fi_sockaddr://10.31.6.12:7471 -
fi_sockaddr_in6://[fe80::6:12]:7471 -
fi_sockaddr://10.31.6.12:7471?qos=3
.PP
Since the string formatted address does not contain any provider
information, the prov_name field of the fabric attribute structure
should be used to filter by provider if necessary.
.TP
\f[I]FI_FORMAT_UNSPEC\f[R]
FI_FORMAT_UNSPEC indicates that a provider specific address format
should be selected.
Provider specific addresses may be protocol specific or a vendor
proprietary format.
Applications that select FI_FORMAT_UNSPEC should be prepared to treat
returned addressing data as opaque.
FI_FORMAT_UNSPEC targets apps which make use of an out of band address
exchange.
Applications which use FI_FORMAT_UNSPEC may use fi_getname() to obtain a
provider specific address assigned to an allocated endpoint.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOCKADDR\f[R]
Address is of type sockaddr.
The specific socket address format will be determined at run time by
interfaces examining the sa_family field.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOCKADDR_IB\f[R]
Address is of type sockaddr_ib (defined in Linux kernel source)
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOCKADDR_IN\f[R]
Address is of type sockaddr_in (IPv4).
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOCKADDR_IN6\f[R]
Address is of type sockaddr_in6 (IPv6).
.TP
\f[I]FI_ADDR_PSMX\f[R]
Address is an Intel proprietary format that is used with their PSMX
(extended performance scaled messaging) protocol.
.SH FLAGS
.PP
The operation of the fi_getinfo call may be controlled through the use
of input flags.
Valid flags include the following.
.TP
\f[I]FI_NUMERICHOST\f[R]
Indicates that the node parameter is a numeric string representation of
a fabric address, such as a dotted decimal IP address.
Use of this flag will suppress any lengthy name resolution protocol.
.TP
\f[I]FI_PROV_ATTR_ONLY\f[R]
Indicates that the caller is only querying for what providers are
potentially available.
All providers will return exactly one fi_info struct, regardless of
whether that provider is usable on the current platform or not.
The returned fi_info struct will contain default values for all members,
with the exception of fabric_attr.
The fabric_attr member will have the prov_name and prov_version values
filled in.
.TP
\f[I]FI_SOURCE\f[R]
Indicates that the node and service parameters specify the local source
address to associate with an endpoint.
If specified, either the node and/or service parameter must be non-NULL.
This flag is often used with passive endpoints.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
fi_getinfo() returns 0 on success.
On error, fi_getinfo() returns a negative value corresponding to fabric
errno.
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[R].
.PP
fi_allocinfo() returns a pointer to a new fi_info structure on success,
or NULL on error.
fi_dupinfo() duplicates a single fi_info structure and all the
substructures within it, returning a pointer to the new fi_info
structure on success, or NULL on error.
Both calls require that the returned fi_info structure be freed via
fi_freeinfo().
.SH ERRORS
.TP
\f[I]FI_EBADFLAGS\f[R]
The specified endpoint or domain capability or operation flags are
invalid.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ENODATA\f[R]
Indicates that no providers could be found which support the requested
fabric information.
.TP
\f[I]FI_ENOMEM\f[R]
Indicates that there was insufficient memory to complete the operation.
.SH NOTES
.PP
If hints are provided, the operation will be controlled by the values
that are supplied in the various fields (see section on
\f[I]fi_info\f[R]).
Applications that require specific communication interfaces, domains,
capabilities or other requirements, can specify them using fields in
\f[I]hints\f[R].
Libfabric returns a linked list in \f[I]info\f[R] that points to a list
of matching interfaces.
\f[I]info\f[R] is set to NULL if there are no communication interfaces
or none match the input hints.
.PP
If node is provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric
address to the given node.
If node is not provided, fi_getinfo will attempt to resolve the fabric
addressing information based on the provided hints.
The caller must call fi_freeinfo to release fi_info structures returned
by fi_getinfo.
.PP
If neither node, service or hints are provided, then fi_getinfo simply
returns the list all available communication interfaces.
.PP
Multiple threads may call \f[C]fi_getinfo\f[R] simultaneously, without
any requirement for serialization.
