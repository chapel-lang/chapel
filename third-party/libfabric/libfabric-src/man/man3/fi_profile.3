.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Fabric profiling interface allows users to obtain configuration or
runtime properties from the providers in the form of
\[lq]variables\[rq].
Providers define variables and make them readable to users through the
profiling interface.
Providers define events and use them to report when an operation has
occurred or a state changed where one or more variables may change their
values.
Users can register callback functions to one or more events, and receive
notifications from providers once an event occurs.
.PP
To support the profiling interface, an endpoint or a domain in a
provider needs to maintain a fid_profile object, and implement the
profiling operations there.
To start a profiling, an open call must be made on the target endpoint
or domain object to obtain the fid_profile object.
If the target object does not support profiling, the open call will fail
with the error code -FI_ENOSYS.
Once a fid_profile object is obtained successfully, it can be used to
query available variables or events and read variables\[cq] values.
.SH VARIABLES
.PP
The profiling variables are defined in providers and are accessible
through the profiling interface.
Variables are specified using struct fi_profile_desc described below.
A variable can be a configuration setting, a runtime state, or a counter
associated with an endpoint or a domain.
Some variables are common and available in most providers, while others
are provider-specific and are only available in one provider.
Users can query available variables and their values using the profiling
interface.
.PP
Provider specific variables are outside the scope of this man page.
libfabric defined variables and their datatypes are described below.
.SS FI_VAR_UNEXP_MSG_CNT (data type: uint64_t)
.PP
This variable returns the current number of unexpected messages that
have been received by the provider which are waiting for matching
receive buffers.
.SS FI_VAR_UNEXP_MSG_QUEUE (data type: struct fi_cq_err_entry)
.PP
This variable returns the current unexpected message queue information,
each entry in the queue is for an unexpect message presented in
fi_cq_err_entry structure.
.SH EVENTS
.PP
Profiling events are defined to notify users that an operation has
occurred or the state of an object has changed, which typically indicate
that one or more variables have been modified.
Events are specified using struct fi_profile_desc described below.
Similar to variables, events may be pre-defined by libfabric or be
provider specific.
Users can register a callback to be notified when an event occurs.
libfabric defined events and the data that corresponds with the event,
if any, are described below.
.PP
Applications may read variables\[cq] values from the event callback when
allowed, but may not register or unregister for events, query for
profiling variables or events.
.PP
libfarbic pre-defined events include:
.SS FI_EVENT_UNEXP_MSG_RECVD
.PP
This event indicates that an unexpected message was received and has
been queued by the provider.
.SS FI_EVENT_UNEXP_MSG_MATCHED
.PP
This event indicates that an unexpected messages that was previously
queued by the provider has been matched.
.PP
These two events can notify a user without any data and rely on the user
to read variables, for example, FI_VAR_UNEXP_MSG_CNT, to get the current
length of the unexpected message queue.
It also can notify a user along with data of variable, for example,
FI_VAR_UNEXP_MSG_QUEUE, to provide the messages information about the
current unexpected message queue.
.SH PROFILE DESCRIPTION
.PP
Variables and events are described using struct fi_profile_desc:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
enum fi_profile_type {
    fi_primitive_type,
    fi_defined_type,
};

struct fi_profile_desc {
    uint32_t id;
    enum fi_profile_type datatype_sel;
    union {
        enum fi_datatype primitive;
        enum fi_type defined;
    } datatype;
    uint64_t flags;
    size_t size;
    const char *name;
    const char *desc;
};
\f[R]
.fi
.SS id
.PP
Each variable or event has a unique identifier (id).
Providers provide this id and users use it to get the variable value or
register callbacks for the event.
.SS datatype
.PP
The data type of the variable.
It can be either a primitive type defined in \f[I]enum fi_datatype\f[R],
or a libfabric structure type defined in \f[I]enum fi_type\f[R].
.SS datatye_sel
.PP
The selector of data type.
It is used to indicate the data type is from \f[I]enum fi_datatype\f[R]
or from \f[I]enum fi_type\f[R].
.SS flags
.PP
The features or restrictions of the variable.
.SS size
.PP
The size (in bytes) of the data.
.SS name
.PP
Reference to the name of a variable or an event.
Storage is allocated and managed by the provider.
Variables or events with the same name should have an identical id.
.SS desc
.PP
Reference to the description of a variable or an event.
Storage is allocated and managed by the provider.
.SH fi_profile_open
.PP
fi_profile_open is used to initiate a profiling on a target endpoint or
domain specified by the fid.
Upon retuning successfully, a fid_profile is returned and can be used to
perform profiling operations.
If the target endpoint or domain does not support fabric profiling
interface, the open call will fail with error code -FI_ENOSYS.
.SH fi_profile_close
.PP
Close the profiling operations and release related resources.
.SH fi_profile_query_vars / fi_profile_query_events
.PP
fi_profile_query_vars and fi_profile_query_events calls can be used to
query available variables or events from the target endpoint or domain
associated with the profile object.
On input, the buffer (\[lq]varlist\[rq] or \[lq]eventlist\[rq]) should
be allocated, and the \[lq]count\[rq] indicates the maximum number of
entries (variables or events) allowed in the buffer.
On output, the \[lq]count\[rq] indicates the actual number of varibles
or events available in the target endpoint or domain.
If the buffer is NULL, only the \[lq]count\[rq] will be set and return.
User can use the \[lq]count\[rq] to allocate space and call the function
again.
The return value of these calls indicates the number of entries returned
the buffer.
.SH fi_profile_reg_callback
.PP
fi_profile_reg_callback registers a callback function to the event.
The event should be in the event list obtained using the
fi_profile_query_events, otherwise, an error code -FI_EINVAL will be
returned.
.SS Callback
.PP
It is used to receive notifications from a provider when an event
occurs.
A callback can also take optional parameters that allows a provider to
push data to the user when an event occurss.
.PP
A callback is defined by the user and called by a provider as an
additional operation, normally before or after data transfer operation.
This will increase the overhead of the operation.
Callback functions must avoid having blocking calls or taking non-trival
time.
And callback functions should limit interactions with a provider to
reading the variables only if allowed.
.PP
The signature of the callback function is:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
int (*callback)(struct fid_profile *prof_fid, struct fi_profile_desc *event,
                void *param, size_t size, void *context)
\f[R]
.fi
.TP
\f[I]prof_fid\f[R]
Reference to the profile object.
.TP
\f[I]event\f[R]
The description of event which the callback has been registered.
.TP
\f[I]param\f[R]
An optional parameter passed to the callback associated with the event.
The data type and size of the param are defined in the event
description.
.TP
\f[I]size\f[R]
The amount of the data pointed by \f[I]param\f[R] if \f[I]param\f[R] is
not NULL.
.TP
\f[I]context\f[R]
The application context passed when the callback is registered.
.SH fi_profile_read_u64
.PP
fi_profile_read_u64 is a wrapper function for FI_UINT64-type variables.
It returns an uint64_t value of the specified variable.
The variable should be in the variable list obtained using
fi_profile_query_vars, otherwise, an error code -FI_EINVAL will be
returned.
.SH fi_profile_start_reads / fi_profile_end_reads
.PP
fi_profile_start_reads and fi_profile_end_reads calls are used when
trying to read multiple variables at the same time.
Variables read in between these two calls are expected to have values
from a single snapshot.
.SH NOTES
.PP
Users should call fi_profile_close to release all resources allocated
for profiling in the provider.
.SH RETURN VALUES
.PP
Returns 0 on success.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
If the provider does not support profiling interface, a -FI_ENOSYS will
be returned.
For fi_profile_query_vars and fi_profile_query_events, a positive return
value indicates the number of variables or events returned in the list.
.PP
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[R].
