.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
A fabric provider implements the application facing software interfaces
needed to access network specific protocols, drivers, and hardware.
The interfaces and structures defined by this man page are exported by
the libfabric library, but are targeted for provider implementations,
rather than for direct use by most applications.
.PP
Integrated providers are those built directly into the libfabric library
itself.
External providers are loaded dynamically by libfabric at initialization
time.
External providers must be in a standard library path or in the
libfabric library search path as specified by environment variable.
Additionally, external providers must be named with the suffix
\[lq]\-fi.so\[rq] at the end of the name.
.PP
Named objects are special purpose resources which are accessible
directly to applications.
They may be used to enhance or modify the behavior of library core.
For details, see the fi_open call below.
.SS fi_prov_ini
.PP
This entry point must be defined by external providers.
On loading, libfabric will invoke fi_prov_ini() to retrieve the
provider\[cq]s fi_provider structure.
Additional interactions between the libfabric core and the provider will
be through the interfaces defined by that struct.
.SS fi_param_define
.PP
Defines a configuration parameter for use by a specified provider.
The help_string and param_name arguments must be non\-NULL, help_string
must additionally be non\-empty.
They are copied internally and may be freed after calling
fi_param_define.
.SS fi_param_get
.PP
Gets the value of a configuration parameter previously defined using
fi_param_define().
The value comes from the environment variable name of the form FI__, all
converted to upper case.
.PP
If the parameter was previously defined and the user set a value,
FI_SUCCESS is returned and (*value) points to the retrieved value.
.PP
If the parameter name was previously defined, but the user did not set a
value, \-FI_ENODATA is returned and the value of (*value) is unchanged.
.PP
If the parameter name was not previously defined via fi_param_define(),
\-FI_ENOENT will be returned and the value of (*value) is unchanged.
.PP
If the value in the environment is not valid for the parameter type,
\-FI_EINVAL will be returned and the value of (*value) is unchanged.
.SS fi_log_enabled / fi_log
.PP
TODO
.SS fi_open
.PP
Open a library resource using a well\-known name.
This feature allows applications and providers a mechanism which can be
used to modify or enhance core library services and behavior.
The details are specific based on the requested object name.
Most applications will not need this level of control.
.PP
The library API version known to the application should be provided
through the version parameter.
The use of attributes is object dependent.
If required, attributes should be provided through the attr parameter,
with attr_len set to the size of the referenced attribute structure.
The following is a list of published names, along with descriptions of
the service or resource to which they correspond.
.TP
.B \f[I]mr_cache\f[R]
The mr_cache object references the internal memory registration cache
used by the different providers.
Additional information on the cache is available in the
\f[C]fi_mr(3)\f[R] man page.
.SS fi_export_fid / fi_import_fid
.PP
Generally, fabric objects are allocated and managed entirely by a single
provider.
Typically only the application facing software interfaces of a fabric
object are defined, for example, the message or tagged operations of an
endpoint.
The fi_export_fid and fi_import_fid calls provide a a mechanism by which
provider facing APIs may be accessed.
This allows the creation of fid objects that are shareable between
providers, or for library plug\-in services.
The ability to export a shareable object is object and provider
implementation dependent.
.PP
Shareable fids typically contain at least 3 main components: a base fid,
a set of exporter defined ops, and a set of importer defined ops.
.SH NOTES
.PP
TODO
.SH PROVIDER INTERFACE
.PP
The fi_provider structure defines entry points for the libfabric core to
use to access the provider.
All other calls into a provider are through function pointers associated
with allocated objects.

.SS version
.PP
The provider version.
For providers integrated with the library, this is often the same as the
library version.
.SS fi_version
.PP
The library interface version that the provider was implemented against.
The provider\[cq]s fi_version must be greater than or equal to an
application\[cq]s requested api version for the application to use the
provider.
It is a provider\[cq]s responsibility to support older versions of the
api if it wishes to supports legacy applications.
For integrated providers
.SS TODO
.SH RETURN VALUE
.PP
Returns FI_SUCCESS on success.
On error, a negative value corresponding to fabric errno is returned.
Fabric errno values are defined in \f[C]rdma/fi_errno.h\f[R].
