fi_net - The net Fabric Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The net provider is a developmental fork of the tcp provider focused on
improving performance and scalability of HPC/AI applications, without
impacting the stability of the tcp provider.
It will be merged back into the tcp provider at a later point in time.
See the \f[C]fi_tcp\f[R](7) man page for additional details on the tcp
provider.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
The following features are supported
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint types\f[R]
\f[I]FI_EP_MSG\f[R] is supported by the net provider.
The net provider shares the same msg endpoint protocol as the tcp
provider.
\f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[R] is supported directly by the net provider, unlike
the tcp provider, which requires the use of the ofi_rxm utility
provider.
The net provider extends its msg endpoint protocol to support rdm
endpoints.
As a result, the net provider\[cq]s rdm endpoint protocol is not
compatible with the ofi_rxm;tcp layered protocol.
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint capabilities\f[R]
The net provider supports \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[R], and
\f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[R].
.TP
\f[I]Shared Rx Context\f[R]
The net provider supports shared receive context
.TP
\f[I]Multi recv buffers\f[R]
The net provider supports multi recv buffers
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
A full list of supported environment variables and their use can be
obtained using the fi_info application.
For example, \[lq]fi_info -g net\[rq] will show all environment
variables usable with the net provider.
