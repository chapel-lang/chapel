.SH NAME
.PP
fi_hook - The Hook Fabric Provider Utility
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The hooking provider is a utility function that can intercept calls to
any provider.
The hook provider is always available, but has zero impact on calls
unless enabled.
It is useful for providing performance data on selected calls or
debugging information.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
Hooking support is enabled through the FI_HOOK environment variable.
To enable hooking, FI_HOOK must be set to the name of one or more of the
available hooking providers.
When multiple hooks are specified, the names must be separated by a
semi-colon.
To obtain a list of hooking providers available on the current system,
one can use the fi_info utility with the `\[en]env' command line option.
Hooking providers are usually identified by `hook' appearing in the
provider name.
.PP
Known hooking providers include the following:
.TP
\f[I]ofi_hook_perf\f[R]
This hooks `fast path' data operation calls.
Performance data is captured on call entrance and exit, in order to
provide an average of how long each call takes to complete.
See the PERFORMANCE HOOKS section for available performance data.
.TP
\f[I]ofi_hook_trace\f[R]
This hooks most of API calls for fabric communications.
The APIs and their runtime parameters are logged to provide detail trace
information for debugging.
See the TRACE HOOKS section for the APIs enabled for trace.
.TP
\f[I]ofi_hook_profile\f[R]
This hooks data operation calls, cq operation calls and mr registration
calls.
The API calls and the amount of data being operated are accumulated, to
provide a view of APIs\[cq] usages and a histogram of data size operated
in a workload execution.
See the PROFILE HOOKS section for the report in the detail.
.SH PERFORMANCE HOOKS
.PP
The hook provider allows capturing inline performance data by accessing
the CPU Performance Management Unit (PMU).
PMU data is only available on Linux systems.
Additionally, access to PMU data may be restricted to privileged
(super-user) applications.
.PP
Performance data is captured for critical data transfer calls: fi_msg,
fi_rma, fi_tagged, fi_cq, and fi_cntr.
Captured data is displayed as logged data using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace
level.
Performance data is logged when the associated fabric is destroyed.
.PP
The environment variable FI_PERF_CNTR is used to identify which
performance counter is tracked.
The following counters are available:
.TP
\f[I]cpu_cycles\f[R]
Counts the number of CPU cycles each function takes to complete.
.TP
\f[I]cpu_instr\f[R]
Counts the number of CPU instructions each function takes to complete.
This is the default performance counter if none is specified.
.SH TRACE HOOKS
.PP
This hook provider allows tracing each API call and its runtime
parameters.
It is enabled by setting FI_HOOK to \[lq]trace\[rq].
.PP
The trace data include the provider\[cq]s name, API function, and
input/output parameter values.\ The APIs enabled for tracing include the
following:
.TP
\f[I]data operation calls\f[R]
This include fi_msg, fi_rma, fi_tagged all data operations.
The trace data contains the data buffer, data size being operated, data,
tags, and flags when applicable.
.TP
\f[I]cq operation calls\f[R]
This includes fi_cq_read, fi_cq_sread, fi_cq_strerror and all cq
operations.
The trace data contains the cq entries based on cq format.
.TP
\f[I]cm operation calls\f[R]
This includes fi_getname, fi_setname, fi_getpeer, fi_connect and all cm
operations.
The trace data contains the target address.
.TP
\f[I]resource creation calls\f[R]
This includes fi_av_open, fi_cq_open, fi_endpoing, fi_cntr_open and
fi_mr operations.
The trace data contains the corresponding attributes used for resource
creation.
.PP
The trace data is logged after API is invoked using the FI_LOG_LEVEL
trace level
.SH PROFILE HOOKS
.PP
This hook provider allows capturing data operation calls and the amount
of data being operated.
It is enabled by setting FI_HOOK to \[lq]profile\[rq].
.PP
The provider counts the API invoked and accumulates the data size each
API call operates.
For data and cq operations, instead of accumulating all data together,
it breaks down the data size into size buckets and accumulates the
amount of data in the corresponding bucket based on the size of the data
operated.
For mr registration operations, it breaks down memory registered per
HMEM iface.
At the end when the associated fabric is destroyed, the provider
generates a profile report.
.PP
The report contains the usage of data operation APIs, the amount of data
received in each CQ format and the amount of memory registered for rma
operations if any exist.
In addition, the data operation APIs are grouped into 4 groups based on
the nature of the operations, message send (fi_sendXXX, fi_tsendXXX),
message receive (fi_recvXXX, fi_trecvXXX), rma read (fi_readXXX) and rma
write (fi_writeXXX) to present the percentage usage of each API.
.PP
The report is in a table format which has APIs invoked in rows, and the
columns contain the following fields:
.TP
\f[I]API\f[R]
The API calls are invoked.
.TP
\f[I]Size\f[R]
Data size bucket that at least one API call operates data in that size
bucket.
The pre-defined size buckets (in Byte) are [0-64] [64-512] [512-1K]
[1K-4K] [4K-64K] [64K-256K] [256K-1M] [1M-4M] [4M-UP].
.TP
\f[I]Count\f[R]
Count of the API calls.
.TP
\f[I]Amount\f[R]
Amount of data the API operated.
.TP
\f[I]% Count\f[R]
Percentage of the API calls over the total API calls in the same data
operation group.
.TP
\f[I]% Amount\f[R]
Percentage of the amount of data from the API over the total amount of
data operated in the same data operation group.
.PP
The report is logged using the FI_LOG_LEVEL trace level.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Hooking functionality is not available for providers built using the
FI_FABRIC_DIRECT feature.
That is, directly linking to a provider prevents hooking.
.PP
The hooking provider does not work with triggered operations.
Application that use FI_TRIGGER operations that attempt to hook calls
will likely crash.
