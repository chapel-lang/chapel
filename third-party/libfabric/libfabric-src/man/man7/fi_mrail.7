.SH NAME
.PP
fi_mrail \- The Multi\-Rail Utility Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The mrail provider (ofi_mrail) is an utility provider that layers over
an underlying provider to enable the use of multiple network ports
(rails).
This increases the total available bandwidth of an underlying provider.
The current status of mrail provider is experimental \- not all
libfabric features are supported and performance is not guaranteed.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.SS Requirements for underlying provider
.PP
mrail provider requires the underlying provider to support the following
capabilities / modes:
.IP \[bu] 2
Buffered receive (FI_BUFFERED_RECV)
.IP \[bu] 2
FI_SOURCE
.IP \[bu] 2
FI_AV_TABLE
.SS Requirements for applications
.PP
Applications need to: * Support FI_MR_RAW MR mode bit to make use of
FI_RMA capability.
* Set FI_OFI_MRAIL_ADDR env variable (see RUNTIME PARAMETERS section
below).
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES

unsupported.

.SH FUNCTIONALITY OVERVIEW
.PP
For messages (FI_MSG, FI_TAGGED), the provider uses different policies
to send messages over one or more rails based on message size (See
\f[I]FI_OFI_MRIAL_CONFIG\f[] in the RUNTIME PARAMETERS section).
Ordering is guaranteed through the use of sequence numbers.
.PP
For RMA, the data is striped equally across all rails.
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
The ofi_mrail provider checks for the following environment variables.
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OFI_MRAIL_ADDR\f[]
Comma delimited list of individual rail addresses.
Each address can be an address in FI_ADDR_STR format, a host name, an IP
address, or a netdev interface name.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OFI_MRAIL_ADDR_STRC\f[]
Deprecated.
Replaced by \f[I]FI_OFI_MRAIL_ADDR\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_OFI_MRAIL_CONFIG\f[]
Comma separated list of \f[C]<max_size>:<policy>\f[] pairs, sorted in
ascending order of \f[C]<max_size>\f[].
Each pair indicated the rail sharing policy to be used for messages up
to the size \f[C]<max_size>\f[] and not covered by all previous pairs.
The value of \f[C]<policy>\f[] can be \f[I]fixed\f[] (a fixed rail is
used), \f[I]round\-robin\f[] (one rail per message, selected in
round\-robin fashion), or \f[I]striping\f[] (striping across all the
rails).
The default configuration is \f[C]16384:fixed,ULONG_MAX:striping\f[].
The value ULONG_MAX can be input as \-1.
