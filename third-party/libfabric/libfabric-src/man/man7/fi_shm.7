fi_shm \- The SHM Fabric Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The SHM provider is a complete provider that can be used on Linux
systems supporting shared memory and process_vm_readv/process_vm_writev
calls.
The provider is intended to provide high\-performance communication
between processes on the same system.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
This release contains an initial implementation of the SHM provider that
offers the following support:
.TP
.B \f[I]Endpoint types\f[]
The provider supports only endpoint type \f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]Endpoint capabilities\f[]
Endpoints cna support any combinations of the following data transfer
capabilities: \f[I]FI_MSG\f[], \f[I]FI_TAGGED\f[], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[], amd
\f[I]FI_ATOMICS\f[].
These capabilities can be further defined by \f[I]FI_SEND\f[],
\f[I]FI_RECV\f[], \f[I]FI_READ\f[], \f[I]FI_WRITE\f[],
\f[I]FI_REMOTE_READ\f[], and \f[I]FI_REMOTE_WRITE\f[] to limit the
direction of operations.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]Modes\f[]
The provider does not require the use of any mode bits.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]Progress\f[]
The SHM provider supports \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[].
Receive side data buffers are not modified outside of completion
processing routines.
The provider processes messages using three different methods, based on
the size of the message.
For messages smaller than 4096 bytes, tx completions are generated
immediately after the send.
For larger messages, tx completions are not generated until the
receiving side has processed the message.

.TP
.B \f[I]Address Format\f[]
The SHM provider uses the address format FI_ADDR_STR, which follows the
general format pattern "[prefix]://[addr]".
The application can provide addresses through the node or hints
parameter.
As long as the address is in a valid FI_ADDR_STR format (contains
"://"), the address will be used as is.
If the application input is incorrectly formatted or no input was
provided, the SHM provider will resolve it according to the following
SHM provider standards:
.RS
.RE
.PP
(flags & FI_SOURCE) ?
src_addr : dest_addr = \- if (node && service) : "fi_ns://node:service"
\- if (service) : "fi_ns://service" \- if (node && !service) :
"fi_shm://node" \- if (!node && !service) : "fi_shm://PID"
.PP
!(flags & FI_SOURCE) \- src_addr = "fi_shm://PID"
.PP
In other words, if the application provides a source and/or destination
address in an acceptable FI_ADDR_STR format (contains "://"), the call
to util_getinfo will successfully fill in src_addr and dest_addr with
the provided input.
If the input is not in an ADDR_STR format, the shared memory provider
will then create a proper FI_ADDR_STR address with either the "fi_ns://"
(node/service format) or "fi_shm://" (shm format) prefixes signaling
whether the addr is a "unique" address and does or does not need an
extra endpoint name identifier appended in order to make it unique.
For the shared memory provider, we assume that the service (with or
without a node) is enough to make it unique, but a node alone is not
sufficient.
If only a node is provided, the "fi_shm://" prefix is used to signify
that it is not a unique address.
If no node or service are provided (and in the case of setting the src
address without FI_SOURCE and no hints), the process ID will be used as
a default address.
On endpoint creation, if the src_addr has the "fi_shm://" prefix, the
provider will append ":[uid]:[dom_idx]:[ep_idx]" as a unique endpoint
name (essentially, in place of a service).
In the case of the "fi_ns://" prefix (or any other prefix if one was
provided by the application), no supplemental information is required to
make it unique and it will remain with only the application\-defined
address.
Note that the actual endpoint name will not include the FI_ADDR_STR
"*://" prefix since it cannot be included in any shared memory region
names.
The provider will strip off the prefix before setting the endpoint name.
As a result, the addresses "fi_prefix1://my_node:my_service" and
"fi_prefix2://my_node:my_service" would result in endpoints and regions
of the same name.
The application can also override the endpoint name after creating an
endpoint using setname() without any address format restrictions.
.PP
\f[I]Msg flags\f[] The provider currently only supports the
FI_REMOTE_CQ_DATA msg flag.
.PP
\f[I]MR registration mode\f[] The provider implements FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR
memory mode.
.PP
\f[I]Atomic operations\f[] The provider supports all combinations of
datatype and operations as long as the message is less than 4096 bytes
(or 2048 for compare operations).
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The SHM provider has hard\-coded maximums for supported queue sizes and
data transfers.
These values are reflected in the related fabric attribute structures
.PP
EPs must be bound to both RX and TX CQs.
.PP
No support for counters.
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
The \f[I]shm\f[] provider checks for the following environment
variables:
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_SHM_SAR_THRESHOLD\f[]
Maximum message size to use segmentation protocol before switching to
mmap (only valid when CMA is not available).
Default: SIZE_MAX (18446744073709551615)
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_SHM_TX_SIZE\f[]
Maximum number of outstanding tx operations.
Default 1024
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \f[I]FI_SHM_RX_SIZE\f[]
Maximum number of outstanding rx operations.
Default 1024
