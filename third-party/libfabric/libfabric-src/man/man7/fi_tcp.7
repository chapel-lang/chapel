.SH NAME
.PP
fi_tcp - The msg sockets Fabric Provider
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
The tcp provider can be used on any system that supports TCP sockets.
The provider is not intended to provide performance improvements over
regular TCP sockets, but rather to allow developers to write, test,and
debug application code even on platforms that do not have
high-performance fabric hardware.
.SH SUPPORTED FEATURES
.PP
The following features are supported
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint types\f[R]
\f[I]FI_EP_MSG\f[R] is the only supported endpoint type.
Reliable datagram endpoint over TCP sockets can be achieved by layering
RxM over tcp provider.
\f[I]FI_EP_RDM\f[R] is supported by layering ofi_rxm provider on top of
the tcp provider.
.TP
\f[I]Endpoint capabilities\f[R]
The tcp provider currently supports \f[I]FI_MSG\f[R], \f[I]FI_RMA\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]Progress\f[R]
Currently tcp provider supports only \f[I]FI_PROGRESS_MANUAL\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]Shared Rx Context\f[R]
The tcp provider supports shared receive context
.TP
\f[I]Multi recv buffers\f[R]
The tcp provider supports multi recv buffers
.SH RUNTIME PARAMETERS
.PP
The tcp provider check for the following environment variables -
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_IFACE\f[R]
A specific network interface can be requested with this variable
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_PORT_LOW_RANGE/FI_TCP_PORT_HIGH_RANGE\f[R]
These variables are used to set the range of ports to be used by the tcp
provider for its passive endpoint creation.
This is useful where only a range of ports are allowed by firewall for
tcp connections.
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_TX_SIZE\f[R]
Default tx context size (default: 256)
.TP
\f[I]FI_TCP_RX_SIZE\f[R]
Default rx context size (default: 256)
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
The tcp provider is implemented over TCP sockets to emulate libfabric
API.
Hence the performance may be lower than what an application might see
implementing to sockets directly, depending on the types of data
transfers the application is trying to achieve.
