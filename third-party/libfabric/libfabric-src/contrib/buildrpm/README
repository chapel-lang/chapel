Script "buildrpmLibfabric.sh" can be used to build RPM from the
stable Libfabric source tarball.

You need to supply one mandatory parameter to the script:
filename of the Libfabric tarball.
There are several voluntary parameters available:

Provider parameters:
-i provider_name
    Include 'provider_name' provider support to the build.

-e provider_name
    Exclude 'provider_name' provider support from the build.


General parameters:
-b
    Build binary packages only
    By default, build binary and source packages

-n
    Do nothing, useful with -v option. If used with -v option,
    it will just print what would have been done.

-o
    Install path of the RPM would be changed to
    /opt/libfabric/_VERSION_. Default install
    path of the RPM is /usr.

-m
    Modulefile will be installed during RPM installation.
    By default, modulefile is not installed.

-d
    Build with debugging support. By default,
    RPM is build without debugging support.

-c parameter
    Add custom configure parameter.

-r parameter
    Add custom RPM build parameter.

-s
    Try to unpack libfabric.spec file from source tarball.
    By default, script will look for libfabric.spec in
    current directory. This option will overwrite
    libfabric.spec file in current directory, if it exists.

-v
    Be verbose.

-h
    Print usage message and exit.

Example usages of the script:
  buildrpmLibfabric.sh -omsv -i usnic -e sockets -e verbs -e psm libfabric-1.4.1.tar.bz2
  buildrpmLibfabric.sh -omsv -c "--disable-silent-rules" libfabric-1.4.1.tar.bz2
