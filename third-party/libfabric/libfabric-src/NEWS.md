## EFA
- Added support for FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE via an acknowledgment packet in the
  provider. Applications that request FI_DELIVERY_COMPLETE will see a
  performance impact from this release onward. The default delivery semantic
  for EFA is still FI_TRANSMIT_COMPLETE and acknowledgment packets will not be
  sent in this mode.
- Added ability for the provider to notify device that it can correctly handle
  receiver not ready (RNR) errors. There are still known issues so this is
  currently turned off by default; the device is still configured to retry
  indefinitely.
- Disable FI_HMEM when FI_LOCAL_COMM is requested due to problems in the
  provider with loopback support for FI_HMEM buffers.
- Use a loopback read to copy from host memory to FI_HMEM buffers in the
  receive path. This has a performance impact, but using the native copy API
  for CUDA can cause a deadlock when the EFA provider is used with NCCL.
- Only allow fork support when the cache is disabled, i.e. the application
  handles registrations (FI_MR_LOCAL) to prevent potential data corruption.
  General fork support will be addressed in a future release.
- Moved EFA fork handler check to only trigger when an EFA device is present
  and EFA is selected by an application.
- Changed default memory registration cache monitor back to userfaultfd due to
  a conflict with the memory hooks installed by Open MPI.

  ordering issues for messages the EFA provider sent via SHM provider.
- Fixed a bug where bounce buffers were used instead of application provided
  memory registration descriptors.

  memory leaks and hangs.

v1.7.0, Mon Jan 7, 2019
=======================

The 1.7 release provides a few enhancements to the libfabric API.
Notably, it extends the fi_info structure in order to report NIC
attributes for domains that have a direct association with network
hardware.  The NIC attributes include details about the device, the
system bus it's attached to, and link state.  NIC attributes are
automatically reported by the fi_info utility application.  See the
fi_nic.3 man page for additional details.

An experimental capability bit is added to optimize receive side
processing.  This is known as variable messages, and targets applications
that do now know what size message a peer with send prior to the
message arriving.  Variable messages can be used to avoid receive
side data copies and eliminate the need for applications to implement
their own rendezvous protocol.  See the fi_msg.3 man page for details on
variable messages and it's sister, buffered messages.

v1.5.0, Wed Aug 9, 2017
============================

The 1.5 release includes updates to the libfabric API and ABI.  As a
result, the ABI bumps from 1.0 to 1.1.  All changes are backwards
compatible with previous versions of the interface.  The following
features were added to the libfabric API.  (Note that individual
providers may not support all new features).  For full details
see the man pages.

- Authorization keys
  Authorization keys, commonly referred to as job keys, are used to
  isolate processes from communicating with other processes for security
  purposes.
- Multicast support
  Datagram endpoints can now support multicast communication.
- (Experimental) socket-like endpoint types
  New FI_SOCK_STREAM and FI_SOCK_DGRAM endpoint types are introduced.
  These endpoint types target support of cloud and enterprise based
  middleware and applications.
- Tagged atomic support
  Atomic operations can now target tagged receive buffers, in
  addition to RMA buffers.
- (Experimental) deferred work queues
  Deferred work queues are enhanced triggerred operations.  They
  target support for collective-based operations.
- New mode bits: FI_RESTRICTED_COMP and FI_NOTIFY_FLAGS_ONLY
  These mode bits support optimized completion processing to
  minimize software overhead.
- Multi-threaded error reporting
  Reading CQ and EQ errors now allow the application to provide the
  error buffer, eliminating the need for the application to synchronize
  between multiple threads when handling errors.
- FI_SOURCE_ERR capability
  This feature allows the provider to validate and report the source
  address for any received messages.
- FI_ADDR_STR string based addressing
  Applications can now request and use addresses provided using a
  standardized string format.  This makes it easier to pass full
  addressing data through a command line, or handle address exchange
  through text files.
- Communication scope capabilities: FI_LOCAL_COMM and FI_REMOTE_COMM
  Used to indicate if an application requires communication with
  peers on the same node and/or remote nodes.
- New memory registration modes
  The FI_BASIC_MR and FI_SCALABLE_MR memory registration modes have
  been replaced by more refined registration mode bits.  This allows
  applications to make better use of provider hardware capabilities
  when dealing with registered memory regions.
- New mode bit: FI_CONTEXT2
  Some providers need more than the size provided by the FI_CONTEXT
  mode bit setting.  To accomodate such providers, an FI_CONTEXT2
  mode bit was added.  This mode bit doubles the amount of context
  space that an application allocates on behalf of the provider.

## BGQ provider notes

- The OFI 1.5 BGQ provider officially supports the Open Fabrics Interfaces
  utilized by the MPICH implementation of the MPI-3 standard.  In addition
  to the MPICH test suite it has been tested by several scientific applications
  running MPICH on BGQ at scale, and several bugs in the provider and MPICH
  have been identified and fixed.  At least one INCITE project is attempting
  to use it for production science.  Support of this provider is a high-
  priority for ALCF, and MPICH users on BGQ are encouraged to utilize it to
  compare function and performance against the PAMI-based default toolchain.
  Any discovered bugs will be quickly addressed with high priority.  Results
  so far have shown significant point-to-point and RMA latency improvements
  over PAMI as well as RMA functional improvements at scale.  The only
  potential drawback is collective performance degradation against the PAMI
  optimizations, but at certain message and partition sizes, performance has
  been observed to be comparable or even better.

## MLX provider notes

- New provider to replace the deprecated mxm provider.

  endpoints emulated over a base provider that supports only MSG end-
  points.

  release onwards.

  if data was sent as part of a connection request [PR #1991]
- Fix invalid completion lengths in the MSG and RDM endpoint
  implementations of fi_recvv and fi_recvmsg [PR #2026]

  endpoints [PR #2033]

## Verbs provider notes

- Add fork support. It is enabled by default and can be turned off by
  setting the FI_FORK_UNSAFE variable to "yes". This can improve
  performance of memory registrations but also makes fork unsafe. The
  following are the limitations of fork support:
  - Fabric resources like endpoint, CQ, EQ, etc. should not be used in
    the forked process.
  - The memory registered using fi_mr_reg has to be page aligned since
    ibv_reg_mr marks the entire page that a memory region belongs to
    as not to be re-mapped when the process is forked (MADV_DONTFORK).
- Fix a bug where source address info was not being returned in
  fi_info when destination node is specified.

- verbs/MSG
  - Add fi_getopt for passive endpoints.

  - Add environment variables for the provider tuning:
    FI_VERBS_RDM_BUFFER_NUM, FI_VERBS_RDM_BUFFER_SIZE,
    FI_VERBS_RDM_RNDV_SEG_SIZE, FI_VERBS_RDM_CQREAD_BUNCH_SIZE,
