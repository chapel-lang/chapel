Fabtests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
Fabtests is a set of examples for fabric providers that demonstrates
various features of libfabric\- high\-performance fabric software
library.
.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
Libfabric defines sets of interface that fabric providers can support.
The purpose of Fabtests examples is to demonstrate some of the major
features.
The goal is to familiarize users with different functionalities
libfabric offers and how to use them.
Although most tests report performance numbers, they are designed to
test functionality and not performance.
The exception are the benchmarks and ubertest.
.PP
The tests are divided into the following categories.
Except the unit tests all of them are client\-server tests.
Not all providers will support each test.
.PP
The test names try to indicate the type of functionality each test is
verifying.
Although some tests work with any endpoint type, many are restricted to
verifying a single endpoint type.
These tests typically include the endpoint type as part of the test
name, such as dgram, msg, or rdm.
.SH Functional
.PP
These tests are a mix of very basic functionality tests that show major
features of libfabric.

.SH Benchmarks
.PP
The client and the server exchange messages in either a ping\-pong
manner, for pingpong named tests, or transfer messages one\-way, for bw
named tests.
These tests can transfer various messages sizes, with controls over
which features are used by the test, and report performance numbers.

They are not guaranteed to provide the best latency or bandwidth
performance numbers a given provider or system may achieve.

.SH Multinode
.PP
This test runs a series of tests over multiple formats and patterns to
help validate at scale.
The patterns are an all to all, one to all, all to one and a ring.
The tests also run across multiple capabilities, such as messages, rma,
atomics, and tagged messages.
Currently, there is no option to run these capabilities and patterns
independently, however the test is short enough to be all run at once.
.SH Ubertest
.PP
This is a comprehensive latency, bandwidth, and functionality test that
can handle a variety of test configurations.
The test is able to run a large number of tests by iterating over a
large number of test variables.
As a result, a full ubertest run can take a significant amount of time.
Because ubertest iterates over input variables, it relies on a test
configuration file for control, rather than extensive command line
options that are used by other fabtests.
A configuration file must be constructed for each provider.
Example test configurations are at test_configs.
.TP
.B \f[I]fi_ubertest\f[]
This test takes a configure file as input.
The file contains a list of variables and their values to iterate over.
The test will run a set of latency, bandwidth, and functionality tests
over a given provider.
It will perform one execution for every possible combination of all
variables.
For example, if there are 8 test variables, with 6 having 2 possible
values and 2 having 3 possible values, ubertest will execute 576 total
iterations of each test.
