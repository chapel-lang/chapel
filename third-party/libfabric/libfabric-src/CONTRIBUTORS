In brief, these bylaws require:

That all contributions be under a license that grants users of
the contributions perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-
free copyright license to reproduce, display, perform, prepare, and have
prepared derivative works.

All contributions are submitted under dual BSD and GPLv2 licenses.

All contributions must be encumbrance free.  Any intellectual property

perpetuity.

All contributions must contain a sign-off tag in each commit message
