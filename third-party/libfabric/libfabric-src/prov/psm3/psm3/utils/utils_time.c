   conversions from timestamps to nanoseconds, but it's close enough for
   our purposes, which is mainly to allow people to show events with nsecs

   different cpu's can have different speeds, etc.

   Some architectures don't have their TSC-equivalent running at anything
   related to the processor speed (e.g. G5 Power systems use a fixed
