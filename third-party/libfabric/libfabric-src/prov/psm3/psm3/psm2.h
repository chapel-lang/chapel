 *
 * @brief PSM2 OPA Messaging Library
 *
 * The PSM2 OPA Messaging API, or PSM2 API, is Intel's low-level
 * user-level communications interface for the OPA family of products.
 * PSM2 users are enabled with mechanisms necessary to implement higher level
 * communications interfaces in parallel environments.
 *
 * Since PSM2 targets clusters of multicore processors, it internally implements
 * two levels of communication: intra-node shared memory communication and
 * inter-node OPA communication.  Both of these levels are encapsulated
 * below the interface and the user is free to assume that intra-node and
 * inter-node communication is transparently handled within PSM.
 *
 * @section compat Compatibility
 *
 * PSM2 can coexist with other QLogic/Pathscale software distributions, such as
 * OpenIB/OpenFabrics, which allows applications to simultaneously target
 * PSM-based and non PSM-based applications on a single node without changing
 * any system-level configuration.  However, PSM2 does not support running
 * PSM-based and non PSM-based communication within the same user process.
 *
 * Except where noted, PSM2 does not assume an SPMD (single program, multiple
 * data) parallel model and extends to MPMD (multiple program, multiple data)
 * environments in specific areas. However, PSM2 assumes the runtime environment
 * to be homogeneous on all nodes in bit width (32-bit or 64-bit) and endianness
 * (little or big) and will fail at startup if any of these assumptions do not
 * hold.  For homogeneous systems PSM2 can run either in 32-bit or 64-bit
 * environments.  Even though both environments should expect similar
 * performance from the API, PSM2 has chosen to favor 64-bit environments in
 * some minor areas.
 *
 * @section ep_model Endpoint Communication Model
 *
 * PSM2 follows an endpoint communication model where an endpoint is defined as
 * an object (or handle) instantiated to support sending and receiving messages
 * to other endpoints.  In order to prevent PSM2 from being tied to a particular
 * parallel model (such as SPMD), control over the parallel layout of endpoints
 * is retained by the user.  Opening endpoints (@ref psm2_ep_open) and
 * connecting endpoints to enable communication (@ref psm2_ep_connect) are two
 * decoupled mechanisms.  Users that do not dynamically change the number of
 * endpoints beyond parallel startup will probably lump both mechanisms
 * together at startup.  Users that wish to manipulate the location and number
 * of endpoints at runtime can do so by explicitly connecting sets or subsets
 * of endpoints.
 *
 * As a side effect, this greater flexibility forces the user to cope with a
 * two-stage initialization process.  In the first stage of opening an endpoint
 * (@ref psm2_ep_open), a user obtains an opaque handle to the endpoint and a
 * globally distributable endpoint identifier (@ref psm2_epid_t).  Prior to the
 * second stage of connecting endpoints (@ref psm2_ep_connect), a user must
 * distribute all relevent endpoint identifiers through an out-of-band
 * mechanism.  Once the endpoint identifiers are successfully distributed to
 * all processes that wish to communicate, the user
 * connects all endpoint identifiers to the locally opened endpoint
 * (@ref psm2_ep_connect).  In connecting the endpoints, the user obtains an
 * opaque endpoint address (@ref psm2_epaddr_t), which is required for all PSM
 * communication primitives.
 *
 *
 * @section components PSM2 Components
 *
 * PSM2 exposes a single endpoint initialization model, but enables various
 * levels of communication functionality and semantics through @e components.
 * The first major component available in PSM2 is PSM2 Matched Queues
 * (@ref psm2_mq), and the second is PSM2 Active Message (@ref psm2_am).
 *
 * Matched Queues (MQ) present a queue-based communication model with the
 * distinction that queue consumers use a 3-tuple of metadata to match incoming
 * messages against a list of preposted receive buffers.  The MQ semantics are
 * sufficiently akin to MPI to cover the entire MPI-1.2 standard.
 *
 * The Active Message (AM) component presents a request/reply model where
 * the arrival of a message triggers the execution of consumer-provided
 * handler code. This can be used to implement many one-sided and two-sided
 * communications paradigms.
 *
 * With future releases of the PSM2 interface, more components will
 * be exposed to accommodate users that implement parallel communication
 * models that deviate from the Matched Queue semantics.  For example, PSM
 * plans to expose a connection management component to make it easier to
 * handle endpoint management for clients without their own connection
 * managers.
 *
 *
 * @section progress PSM2 Communication Progress Guarantees
 *
 * PSM2 internally ensures progress of both intra-node and inter-node messages,
 * but not autonomously.  This means that while performance does not depend
 * greatly on how the user decides to schedule communication progress,
 * explicit progress calls are required for correctness.  The @ref psm2_poll
 * function is available to make progress over all PSM2 components in a generic
 * manner.  For more information on making progress over many communication
 * operations in the MQ component, see the @ref mq_progress documentation.
 *
 *
 * @section completion PSM2 Completion semantics
 *
 * PSM2 implements the MQ component, which documents its own
 * message completion semantics (@ref mq_completion).
 *
 *
 * @section error_handling PSM2 Error handling
 *
 * PSM2 exposes a list of user and runtime errors enumerated in @ref psm2_error.
 * While most errors are fatal in that the user is not expected to be able to
 * recover from them, PSM2 still allows some level of control.  By
 * default, PSM2 returns all errors to the user but as a convenience, allows
 * users to either defer errors internally to PSM2 or to have PSM2 return all
 * errors to the user (callers to PSM2 functions).  PSM2 attempts to deallocate
 * its resources as a best effort, but exits are always non-collective with
 * respect to endpoints opened in other processes.  The user is expected to be
 * able to handle non-collective exits from any endpoint and in turn cleanly
 * and independently terminate the parallel environment.  Local error handling
 * can be handled in three modes:
 *
 * Errors and error handling can be individually registered either globally or
 * per-endpoint:
 * @li @b Per-endpoint error handling captures errors for functions where the
 * error scoping is determined to be over an endpoint.  This includes all
 * communication functions that include an EP or MQ handle as the first
 * parameter.
 *
 * @li @b Global error handling captures errors for functions where a
 * particular endpoint cannot be identified or for @ref psm2_ep_open, where
 * errors (if any) occur before the endpoint is opened.
 *
 * Error handling is controlled by registering error handlers (@ref
 * psm2_error_register_handler).  The global error handler can
 * be set at any time (even before @ref psm2_init), whereas a per-endpoint error
 * handler can be set as soon as a new endpoint is successfully created.  If a
 * per-endpoint handle is not registered, the per-endpoint handler inherits
 * from the global error handler at time of open.
 *
 * PSM2 predefines two different mechanisms for handling errors:
 *
 * @li PSM-internal error handler (@ref PSM2_ERRHANDLER_PSM_HANDLER)
 * @li No-op PSM2 error handler where errors are returned
 *     (@ref PSM2_ERRHANDLER_NO_HANDLER)
 *
 * The default PSM-internal error handler effectively frees the user from
 * explicitly handling the return values of ever PSM2 function but may not
 * return to the user in a function determined to have caused a fatal error.
 *
 * The No-op PSM2 error handler bypasses all error handling functionality and
 * always returns the error to the user.  The user can then use @ref
 * psm2_error_get_string to obtain a generic string from an error code (compared
 * to a more detailed error message available through registering of error
 * handlers).
 *
 * For even more control, users can register their own error handlers to have
 * access to more precise error strings and selectively control when an when
 * not to return to callers of PSM2 functions.  All error handlers shown defer
 * error handling to PSM2 for errors that are not recognized using @ref
 * psm2_error_defer.  Deferring an error from a custom error handler is
 * equivalent to relying on the default error handler.
 *
 * @section env_var Environment variables
 *
 * Some PSM2 behaviour can be controlled via environment variables.
 *
 * @li @b PSM3_DEVICES. PSM2 implements three devices for communication which
 * are, in order,  @c self, @c shm and @c hfi.  For PSM2 jobs that do not
 * require shared-memory communications, @b PSM3_DEVICES can be specified as @c
 * self, @c hfi.  Similarly, for shared-memory only jobs, the @c hfi device
 * can be disabled.  It is up to the user to ensure that the endpoint ids
 * passed in @ref psm2_ep_connect do not require a device that has been
 * explicitly disabled by the user.  In some instances, enabling only the
 * devices that are required may improve performance.
 *
 * @li @b PSM2_TRACEMASK. Depending on the value of the tracemask, various parts
 * of PSM2 will output debugging information.  With a default value of @c 0x1,
 * informative messages will be printed (this value should be considered a
 * minimum).  At @c 0x101, startup and finalization messages are added to the
 * output.  At @c 0x1c3, every communication event is logged and should hence
 * be used for extreme debugging only.
 *
 * @li @b PSM3_MULTI_EP. By default, only one PSM2 endpoint may be opened in
 * a process. With the correct setting of this environment variable, a process
 * may open more than one PSM2 endpoint. In order to enable multiple endpoint
 * per process support, the value of this environment variable should be set
 * to "1" or "yes".
 *
 * @section thr_sfty Thread safety and reentrancy
 * Unless specifically noted otherwise, all PSM2 functions should not be considered
 * to be thread safe or reentrant.

/** @brief OPA endpoint creation
 *
 * Function used to create a new local communication endpoint on an OPA
 * adapter.  The returned endpoint handle is required in all PSM2 communication
 * operations, as PSM2 can manage communication over multiple endpoints.  An
 * opened endpoint has no global context until the user connects the endpoint
 * to other global endpoints by way of @ref psm2_ep_connect.  All local endpoint
 * handles are globally identified by endpoint IDs (@ref psm2_epid_t) which are
 * also returned when an endpoint is opened.  It is assumed that the user can
 * provide an out-of-band mechanism to distribute the endpoint IDs in order to
 * establish connections between endpoints (@ref psm2_ep_connect for more
 * information).
 *
 * @param[in] unique_job_key Endpoint key, to uniquely identify the endpoint in
 *                           a parallel job.  It is up to the user to ensure
 *                           that the key is globally unique over a period long
 *                           enough to prevent duplicate keys over the same set
 *                           of endpoints (see comments below).
 *
 * @param[in] opts Open options of type @ref psm2_ep_open_opts
 *                 (see @ref psm2_ep_open_opts_get_defaults).
 *
 * @param[out] ep User-supplied storage to return a pointer to the newly
 *                created endpoint.  The returned pointer of type @ref psm2_ep_t
 *                is a local handle and cannot be used to globally identify the
 *                endpoint.
 * @param[out] epid User-supplied storage to return the endpoint ID associated
 *                  to the newly created local endpoint returned in the @c ep
 *                  handle.  The endpoint ID is an integral type suitable for
 *                  uniquely identifying the local endpoint.
 *
 * PSM2 does not internally verify the consistency of the uuid, it is up to the
 * user to ensure that the uid is unique enough not to collide with other
 * currently-running jobs.  Users can employ two mechanisms to obtain a uuid.
 *
 * 1. Use an OS or library-specific uuid generation utility, that complies with
 *    OSF DCE 1.1, such as @c uuid_generate on Linux or @c uuid_create on
 *    FreeBSD.
 *    (see http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009629399/uuid_create.htm)
 *
 * 2. Manually pack a 16-byte string using a utility such as /dev/random or
 *    other source with enough entropy and proper seeding to prevent two nodes
 *    from generating the same uuid_t.
 *
 * The following options are relevent when opening an endpoint:
 *   @li @c timeout establishes the number of nanoseconds to wait before
 *                  failing to open a port (with -1, defaults to 15 secs).
 *   @li @c unit sets the OPA unit number to use to open a port (with
 *               -1, PSM2 determines the best unit to open the port).  If @c
 *               PSM3_NIC is set in the environment, this setting is ignored.
 *   @li @c affinity enables or disables PSM2 setting processor affinity.  The
 *                   option can be controlled to either disable (@ref
 *                   PSM2_EP_OPEN_AFFINITY_SKIP) or enable the affinity setting
 *                   only if it is already unset (@ref
 *                   PSM2_EP_OPEN_AFFINITY_SET) or regardless of affinity being
 *                   set or not (@ref PSM2_EP_OPEN_AFFINITY_FORCE).
 *                   If @c PSM3_NO_CPUAFFINITY is set in the environment, this
 *                   setting is ignored.
 *   @li @c shm_mbytes sets a maximum number of megabytes that can be allocated
 *		       to each local endpoint ID connected through this
 *		       endpoint (with -1, defaults to 10 MB).
 *   @li @c sendbufs_num sets the number of send buffers that can be
 *                       pre-allocated for communication (with -1, defaults to
 *                       512 buffers of MTU size).
 *   @li @c network_pkey sets the protection key to employ for point-to-point
 *                       PSM2 communication.  Unless a specific value is used,
 *                       this parameter should be set to
 *                       PSM2_EP_OPEN_PKEY_DEFAULT.
 *
 * @warning By default, PSM2 limits the user to calling @ref psm2_ep_open only
 * once per process and subsequent calls will fail. In order to enable creation
 * of multiple endoints per process, one must properly set the environment variable
 * @ref PSM3_MULTI_EP before calling @ref psm2_init.
