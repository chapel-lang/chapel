/*
 * Receiver thread support.
 *
 * By default, polling in the driver asks the chip to generate an interrupt on
 * every packet.  When the driver supports POLLURG we can switch the poll mode
 * to one that requests interrupts only for packets that contain an urgent bit
 * (and optionally enable interrupts for hdrq overflow events).  When poll
 * returns an event, we *try* to make progress on the receive queue but simply
 * go back to sleep if we notice that the main thread is already making
 * progress.
 *
 * returns:
 * 	PSM2_IS_FINALIZED - fd_pipe was closed, caller can exit rcvthread
 * 	PSM2_NO_PROGRESS - got an EINTR, need to be called again with same
 * 			next_timeout value
 * 	PSM2_TIMEOUT - poll waited full timeout, no events
 * 	PSM2_OK - poll found an event and processed it
 * 	PSM2_INTERNAL_ERR - unexpected error attempting poll()
 * updates counters: pollok (poll's which made progress), pollcyc (time spent
 * 	polling without finding any events)
