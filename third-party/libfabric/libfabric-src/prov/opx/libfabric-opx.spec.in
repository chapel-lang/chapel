%description
libfabric provides a user-space API to access high-performance fabric
services, such as RDMA.

This RPM provides the %{provider_formal} provider as a "plugin" to an existing
libfabric installation.  This plugin will override older %{provider_formal}
provider functionality in the existing libfabric installation.
