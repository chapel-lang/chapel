======================
RE2 for Chapel release
======================

Chapel can be built (by setting CHPL_REGEXP=re2) to include the RE2 library
(see http://code.google.com/p/re2/).

For more information on the current support for RE2 within Chapel,
please refer to the Regexp module documentation available at
 http://chapel.cray.com/docs/latest/modules/standard/Regexp.html
For more information about RE2 itself, please refer to the website above
or to the README in the re2/ subdirectory of this directory.

We modify the RE2 library to allow regular expressions in the format
string for Chapel's readf() for searching on QIO channels.

Modified from revision:
"re2: incorporate Chromium fixes"
git commit cc56ba02d9d2bdafa614ad5ebf564dde287625bb

- added option for dotnl
- moved NFA and OnePass searches to be implemeted with templates
  to allow string types other than const char*
  Also modified these to use begin_reading() instead of begin()
  for the pointer that will be dereferenced.
- added file_strings.h to represent a portion of a file accessible
  by calling some read routine (through a pointer)
  and modified string_piece to include it.
- implemented RE2::MatchFile which searches a buffer
  (optionally) and then some other string type.
- RE2 constructor now computes min/max possible match length
  for use in MatchFile.

We have created a patch for RE2 in hg_diff_g.patch. That, along with the
files file_strings.h and file_strings.cc should allow a different version
of RE2 to be patched.
