re2 README for Chapel
=====================

This modified version of re2 is based on the official 2018-10-01(0a6326b)
release obtained from:

  https://github.com/google/re2

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to re2 should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.

Note that since RE2 uses C++11 atomics, it may not build or function with
certain older compilers. In particular, if you are using GCC, we
recommend at least GCC version 5. While this version of RE2 will build
with GCC 4.7, the C++11 atomics were not sufficiently tested until GCC 5.

Chapel modifications to re2
===========================

We modify the RE2 library to allow regular expressions in the format
string for Chapel's readf() for searching on QIO channels. The details
of these modifications are as follows:

- moved NFA and OnePass searches to be implemented with templates
  to allow string types other than const char*
  Also modified these to use begin_reading() instead of begin()
  for the pointer that will be dereferenced.
- added file_strings.h to represent a portion of a file accessible
  by calling some read routine (through a pointer)
  and modified string_piece to include it.
- implemented RE2::MatchFile which searches a buffer
  (optionally) and then some other string type.
- RE2 constructor now computes min/max possible match length
  for use in MatchFile.

Upgrading RE2 versions
======================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/re2/re2-src/ contains the
un-tarballed RE2 package contents.  Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/re2/:

  # create a tarball storing Chapel+RE2 changes
  tar cvzf re2-src.tgz re2-src

  # Replace re2-src with a new checkout of RE2's repository
  mv re2-src re2-orig

  git clone https://github.com/google/re2 re2-src
  cd re2-src

  # Use the previously updated version
  git checkout <version> # <version> is the version last updated to
  cd ..

  tar xvzf re2-src.tgz

  # Now, re2-src is a git repository with Chapel changes staged.
  # Use the usual git techniques to update, e.g. git commit/git stash, git pull
  # Be sure to update to a version listed in
  #   https://github.com/google/re2/releases
