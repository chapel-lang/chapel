libdivide README for Chapel
===========================

Chapel runtime support for using libdivide can be built by setting
CHPL_LIBDIVIDE=libdivide.

For more information about libdivide itself, please refer to the
website: http://libdivide.com/

libdivide has been tested with clang, gcc, and Visual C++.

Instructions

To use Chapel's third-party build support for libdivide, change
directory to $CHPL_HOME/third-party/libdivide and type 'make'.

When the build completes the libdivide.h header file (which is all it
consists of) will be in $CHPL_HOME/third-party/libdivide/libdivide.

To use libdivide to improve multi-ddata performance, set the following
environment variable when you compile Chapel programs:

export CHPL_LIBDIVIDE=libdivide

Note that this setting does not affect building the runtime or
compiler.  It only affects user program compilation.
