GASNet ChangeLog 
----------------
$Revision: 1.56 $

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-14-2012 : Release 1.18.2

* IBM PAMI (pami-conduit)
  - This release includes a BETA of native support for the IBM PAMI
    (Parallel Active Message Interface) network API, found on the IBM BG/Q
    and on systems running IBM's Parallel Environment (IBM PE) software
    for Linux (both x86-64 and PowerPC architectures).
  - Testing on an IBM Power 775 system (a.k.a. PERCS or Blue Waters) with
    its HFI network passed all GASNet and Berkeley UPC tests.
  - Testing on an IBM BlueGene/Q shows there are still some unexplained
    failures at the time of this release.
  - This code has not yet been tested on IBM PE clusters running PAMI over
    InfiniBand or Ethernet.  Reports of such testing would be appreciated.
    Access to such systems for testing would be GREATLY appreciated.
  - The performance of pami-conduit has not been fully tuned, however we
    believe that the implementation is correct (with only minor bugs
    remaining on BlueGene/Q).
  - This is still only a BETA-quality implementation, and performance
    improvements are anticipated in future releases.

* Cray XE & XK series (gemini-conduit)
  - Added Cray XK series as a supported/tested platform.
  - Reduced by more than 60% the memory used for receiving AMs (bug 3067).
  - Made several code cleanups on the road to production-quality.
  - This conduit is still "BETA" due to known room for improvements.

* InfiniBand (ibv- and vapi-conduits)
  - Improved scalability (time and memory) of startup/shutdown code
    + Switch to native InfiniBand communication earlier in startup.
    + Use more scalable communication pattern for exit coordination.
    + Made communications performance improvements to sockets code in the
      ssh-spawner used for startup when spawning via MPI is unavailable
      or has been disabled.
  - Made improvements to dynamic connection support
    + The dynamic connection code has been more robust in the face of lost
      packets through use of TCP-inspired adaptive timeouts.
    + The dynamic connection code has been made insensitive to the problem
      of inattentive peers (ones not making frequent enough calls to GASNet)
      through the use of an internal thread which wakes up only on arrival
      of network traffic related to dynamic connection setup.
  - Made improvements in the Active Message progress thread
    + The AM progress thread is finally available in ibv-conduit.
    + The maximum wake-up rate of the progress thread can now be limited.
    + See the conduit README file for documentation on GASNET_RCV_THREAD
      and GASNET_RCV_THREAD_RATE environment variables for more info.

* PSHM (intra-node shared memory)
  - Extended PSHM-via-XPMEM support to SGI Altix series, where it is
    available at configure time, but not currently used by default.
  - Support for PSHM over SystemV shared memory no longer requires a
    working implementation of mmap() (bug 3066).
    + This is the first PSHM support for Cygwin.
  - Expanded PSHM docs, including notes for configuration on Cygwin.
    See docs/pshm-design.txt in the GASNet sources.

* Platform support/portability
  - Ported network-independent code to the IBM BlueGene/Q.
    This provides fully-functioning GASNet-Tools and smp- and mpi-conduits.
  - Implemented native 64-bit atomics for ILP32 builds with Apple XCode-4.x,
    resolving bug 3071 which required disabling them in the 1.18.0 release.
  - Force PGI compilers on MacOS to honor the documented ABI (bug 2150).
  - Made several changes to ssh-spawner sockets code for better portability.
  - Disabled ASLR (address-space layout randomization) in MacOS Lion (and
    newer) via the GASNET_LDFLAGS.
  - No longer trust Cygwin's gethostid(), which has known problem.
  - Added initial support for Clang (bug 3075).
    + Not yet listed in README as officially supported for any target
    + x86 and x86-64 targets have been well tested on Linux and *BSD
    + x86 and x86-64 targets have been lightly tested on MacOS Lion
    + ppc64 target has been lightly tested on BG/Q platforms
  - Made fixes for __attribute__ configure probes
    + The __always_inline__ probe failed incorrectly with gcc-4.7.x.
    + The __format__ probe failed incorrectly with PGI compilers.
  - Improved support for "old" C compilers by removing or reducing
    unnecessary C99 dependencies.

* General
  - Fixed an error in README's instructions for use of the Makefile
    fragments, which was missing "$(GASNET_CPPFLAGS)" in the ".c.o" rule.
  - Continued improvement to signal handling for smp-conduit for fewer
    "orphans" when an application is terminated by a signal or abort().
  - Implemented/documented GASNET_THREAD_STACK_{MIN,PAD} environment vars.
  - Annotated many (but not yet all) known-benign memory leaks in the
    report generated when GASNET_MALLOCFILE is set (for bug 3088).
  - Improved documentation (in code comments) for conduit implementers.

* Build and configure
  - Most instances of "debug vs. optimize compilation conflict" in the
    MPI compiler are now resolved without user intervention.
  - Support for GASNet's error-checking implementation of malloc and its
    associates can now be controlled independent of the --enable-debug
    configure option (but is still enabled by default when configured
    with --enable-debug).  This resolves bug 3089.
    + "--enable-debug-malloc" enables error-checking malloc while not
      enabling other runtime assertions associated with "--enable-debug".
    + "--enable-debug --disable-debug-malloc" yields a debug build without
      GASNet's error-checking wrappers for malloc and related calls.  This
      is useful when an external debugging malloc library is to be used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-30-2011 : Release 1.18.0

* Cray-XE series (gemini-conduit):
  - This release includes a BETA of native support for the Cray XE network.
  - The performance of gemini-conduit has not been tuned, however we believe
    that the implementation is correct (with only minor bugs remaining).
  - This is still only a BETA-quality implementation, and significant
    performance improvements are anticipated in future releases.

* General
  - Implemented faster atomics for x86, x86-64 and PPC64.
  - Improved signal handling for smp-conduit for fewer "orphans" when

  - Field remote_addr in gasnet_seginfo_t has been removed and the signature
    of gasnet_getNodeInfo() has changed.  If your GASNet client was using
    these undocumented interfaces, then it will need to be updated.

* Platform support/portability
  - Enabled partial backtrace support for Cray-XT and XE series systems.
  - Make allowances for odd sbrk() implementation on Darwin.

10-17-2011 : Release 1.17.6
* A "stable snapshot" - first release candidate for 1.18.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
09-23-2011 : Release 1.17.4 (gemini-conduit only beta release)

  - This is a Beta release featuring an initial native implementation
    for the Gemini interconnect of the Cray XE.
  - The performance of gemini-conduit has not been tuned, but we believe
    that the implementation is correct.
  - Relative to the previous stable release, 1.16.2, this Beta includes
    several miscellaneous changes not described here.  Most are fixes for
    bugs or improvements to performance, and none are suspected to make
    this release any less stable than 1.16.2.
  - This Beta has been mostly tested on Cray XE6 systems, but is not
    known or suspected to be less stable on any other specific platforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      specification which can greatly reduce the memory and HCA resource
      requirements for large node counts, when used together with SRQ.
      For more details on SRQ and XRC see vapi-conduit/README (source)
      or share/doc/gasnet/README-ibv (installed).
    + This release adds support for operating ibv- and vapi-conduits
      without connecting all pairs of nodes at startup (avoiding the
      associated costs in time, memory and HCA resources).
      For more information see vapi-conduit/README (source) or
      share/doc/gasnet/README-{ibv,vapi} (installed) for documentation

    + GASNET_STATSNODES      - limits GASNET_STATSFILE output
    + GASNET_MALLOCNODES     - limits GASNET_MALLOCFILE output

* InfiniBand (ibv-conduit):
  - This release features a (re)implementation of Active Messages for
    ibv-conduit via SRQ (Shared Receive Queue) which greatly reduces
    the memory requirements for large node counts.
  - Implementation now supports (in theory) as many as 65535 GASNet
    nodes (processes), up from 16384.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-24-2010 : Release 1.15.8
* A "stable snapshot" - second release candidate for 1.16.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-17-2010 : Release 1.15.6
* A "stable snapshot" - first release candidate for 1.16.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2010 : Release 1.15.4 (ibv-conduit only beta release)
  - This is a Beta release featuring an initial (re)implementation of
    Active Messages for ibv-conduit via SRQ (Shared Receive Queue).
  - SRQ is an InfiniBand API mechanism for more scalable memory usage as
    the number of connected peers increases.
  - In previous releases of ibv-conduit each additional peer required an
    additional GASNET_AM_CREDITS_PP buffers (32 by default) be allocated
    for receiving AM traffic.  At 4KB per buffer plus additional metadata
    for management, this would amount to about 133KB per peer.
  - The introduction of SRQ allows ibv-conduit to operate with no more
    than 1024 AM receive buffers (4MB + management overheads) independent
    of the number of peers, with little or no performance impact on well-
    behaved applications.
  - This initial implementation is known to deadlock under very rare AM-
    intensive workloads, or when certain settings are reduced to values
    much lower than their defaults.  This will be resolved in the next
    Beta, prior to the 1.16.0 release.
  - There is no SRQ implementation for vapi-conduit.
  - Relative to the previous stable release, 1.14.2, this Beta includes
    several miscellaneous changes not described here.  Most are fixes for
    bugs or improvements to performance, and none are suspected to make
    this release any less stable than 1.14.2.
  - This Beta has been mostly tested on ibv-conduit systems, but is not
    known or suspected to be less stable on any other specific platforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-20-2010 : Release 1.14.2

  - VAPI recv thread is now disabled by default (but still available via env setting)

* MPI:
  - Significant performance and stability improvements on mpi-conduit,
    especially on systems where the MPI-level flow control is lacking or
    unreliable (eg XT-3, BGL).
  - Split request/reply traffic onto separate MPI communicators to ensure
    bounded AMMPI-level buffer space utilization, even for degenerate cases
  - Added an AMMPI-level token-based flow control solution to prevent the
    crashes observed under heavy MPI unexpected message loads on various
    systems (XT3, Altix)
  - Add workaround for an IBM MPI ordering bug that could cause deadlock
    under heavy communication patterns.
  - Other misc tuning along the primary control paths and new tuning knobs

* Ethernet/UDP:
  - Add cross-platform spawn support for cross-compiled targets

* GASNet spec 1.8:
  - expose the GASNet release version as public macros:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
08-27-2004 : Release 1.4

* New conduits added:
  - udp-conduit: a portable conduit that implements GASNet over any standard
    TCP/IP stack. This is the now the recommended conduit for clusters with
    only ethernet networking hardware (faster than mpi-conduit over TCP-based MPI).
    See udp-conduit/README for important info on job spawning. Note that
    udp-conduit requires a working C++ compiler (but when none is available, it can
    be disabled with --disable-udp).
  - sci-conduit: an experimental conduit over Dolphin-SCI. Current
    implementation is core-only, performance improvements are on the way in the
    next version.

* GASNet2 extended API interface extensions:
  - Implement reference version of GASNet collective operations
  - Implement reference version of GASNet vector/indexed/strided put/get operations
  - updated GASNet 2.0 spec to be released soon
 
* GASNet Spec v1.6: 
  - Add gasnet_hsl_trylock()
  - Specify calls to gasnet_hold_interrupts() and gasnet_resume_interrupts()
    are ignored while holding an HSL.
  - Clarify the upper limit of in-flight non-blocking operations is 2^16-1
  - Clarify gasnet_handle_t is a scalar type
  - Small clarifications and minor editorial corrections

* gm-conduit:
  - fix thread-safety problems in firehose library that caused stability
    problems in GASNET_PAR mode
  - detect versions of GM driver with broken RDMA get support and don't use it
    there
  - remove dependency on gethostbyname to improve reliability of static linking
    on Linux
  - improvements to gasnetrun-gm

* vapi-conduit:
  - add SEGMENT_LARGE and SEGMENT_EVERYTHING support
  - many performance improvements

* lapi-conduit:
  - add workaround for a recent LAPI performance bug on Federation hardware
  - gasnet_exit stability improvements

* elan-conduit:
  - upgrades for recent libelan versions

* Configure changes:
  - add autodetection of all conduits, whenever possible. On some systems one
    may still need to  set some environment variables before running configure
    to indicate the install location of network drivers.
  - detect and reject the buggy gcc 3.2.0-2 compilers
  - handle systems lacking pthreads
  - improved sanity checks for MPI_CFLAGS

* Makefile changes
  - Add a set of manual-overrides for compilation of the GASNet libraries and
    tests, ie "make MANUAL_LIBCFLAGS=..." - see README
  - Fix "gmake prefix=/new/path install" to work correctly, even when it
    differs from configure-time prefix
  - Add limited support for parallel make (not recommended for general use)

* GASNet infrastructure ported to Cray X1, AMD Athlon/Opteron, Sun Pro C, HP C

* Add gasnet_trace contributed tool, which automatically parses and summarizes
  GASNet trace files

* Add an experimental spin-poll throttling feature to reduce lock contention
  for GASNET_PAR mode, configure --enable-throttle-poll

* Restructure use of local memory barriers to accommodate architectures
  requiring read memory barriers

* Fix GASNet headers to be C++ friendly

* Many miscellaneous performance, stability and functionality improvements

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11-10-2003 : Release 1.3

* Added InfiniBand support in vapi-conduit - currently only SEGMENT_FAST is supported

* elan-conduit: 
  - updated for the most recent version of libelan
  - fix a few race conditions

* gm-conduit:
  - updated for GM 2.0, including RDMA get support
  - Added 64-bit support
  - Reworked the spawner to work with mpiexec, gexec, MPICH mpirun and a custom spawner

* lapi-conduit:
  - Fix bugs related to varying LAPI uhdr payload size across systems - this is
    now queried automatically at runtime

* GASNet spec: 
  - gasnet_hold_interrupts() and gasnet_resume_interrupts() calls are now
    required to be ignored by the implementation within an AM handler context.
  - Added gasnet_set_waitmode() function

* Add a logGP test program for GASNet conduits

* Add a threaded tester for gasnet threaded clients

* Added a GASNet/MPI test that tests the compatibility of a GASNet conduit with
  MPI calls made by the GASNet client. 

* All GASNet conduits other than gm are now fully compatible with limited MPI
  calls from the GASNet client code. In order to prevent deadlock and ensure
  safety, GASNet and MPI communication should be separated by barriers.

* Factor the firehose page registration system into a new, separate firehose
  library with a public interface, for use by gm-conduit and vapi-conduit
 
* Use "adaptive" pthreads mutexes on Linux (when available), for better SMP performance

* Added support for new platforms: Solaris-SPARC 64-bit 
  and new compilers:  Portland Group C, SunPro C and Intel C

* Add SIGCONT as an additional option for unfreezing a GASNet application
  This is a useful option for debugging GASNet apps which lack debugging symbols
  (but may still have enough info to give you a stack trace, etc) A GASNet app
  frozen by GASNET_FREEZE can now be unfrozen by sending: "kill -CONT pid"
  to each process, or on some systems by typing control-Z on the console to
  suspend the process and then fg to resume it (sends a SIGCONT for you).

* HSL calls now compile away to nothing when HSL's are unnecessary 

* Merged AMMPI v0.8, includes fixes to rare buffer overflows and small memory leaks

* fixed pthread barrier errors caused by a race condition

* Minor semantic change to no-interrupt sections -
  gasnet_{hold,resume}_interrupts() are now officially ignored within a GASNet
  handler context (where interrupts are already suspended anyhow). 

* add new function gasnet_set_waitmode() to control waiting behavior

* Use an atexit handler to make sure we finalize the trace/stats file, even 
  if the client exits without calling gasnet_exit

* Fixes to gasneti_local_membar(), especially for SMP/UNI Linux kernels and PowerPC

* New significant GASNet conduit programming practices:
  gasneti_{malloc,calloc,free}, gasneti_assert, GASNETI_CLIENT_THREADS,
  GASNETI_CONDUIT_THREADS, (N)DEBUG -> GASNET_(N)DEBUG, STATS,TRACE ->
  GASNET_{STATS,TRACE}

* Many minor fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2003 : Release 1.2

* Greatly increased the number of platforms supported - notably, this release
  adds support for FreeBSD, IRIX, HPUX, Solaris, MSWindows-Cygwin and Mac OSX,
  as well as the SunPro, MIPSPro, Portland Group and Intel C compilers. See the
  top-level README for the complete list of supported platforms.

* Added the smp-conduit, which implements pure loopback to support GASNet
  clients on platforms lacking a network.

* Remove 256-node scalability limit - mpi, elan and lapi conduits now
  theoretically scale to 2^31 nodes. gm conduit scales to 2^16 nodes.

* Merge v0.7 of AMMPI - improved latency performance, better scalability, and
  fixes for LAM/MPI

* Fix bug 120 - gasnet_exit now reliably kills the entire job on all conduits
  in various collective and non-collective invocation situations.

* New switches GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSLOCAL and GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSREMOTE which
  optimize away the locality check for put/gets implemented by
  gasnete_islocal() 

* Updates to the tracing system - separate statistics from tracing to allow
  finer user control controlled by new environment variables - GASNET_STATSMASK
  and GASNET_STATSFILE

* Major cleanup to the gm-conduit bootstrap code

* Internal structural changes to gasnet_extended.h to provide more flexibility
  for conduit overrides

* Minor wording clarifications to the GASNet spec

* Many minor bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
04-17-2003 : Release 1.1

* Added lots of conduit user and design documentation
* Fix bugs with gasnet_register_value_t functionality, in some cases garbage 
  was returned by gasnet_get_val() in the upper bytes
* Fix bug 51 - endianness bugs on gasnet_*_val()
* Tweak the gcc optimizer settings to ensure that we get full inlining
* Ensure gasnet_exit() or fatal signals always correctly shut down the global 
  job (mpi and elan conduits - gm and lapi still have known problems)
* Add strong configure warnings about using gcc 2.96 - users are highly 
  recommended to avoid this broken compiler
* Ensure configure caching is always on
* Basic infrastructure cleanups to the conduit Makefile fragments
* Fix a shutdown-time crash when tracing
* Add GASNET_CONFIG_STRING to spec & implementation and embed it in library
* Add a number of minor clarifications to the GASNet spec
* Clean up licensing issues

* elan-conduit: 
 - fixups for better handling of elan memory exhaustion
 - preallocate AMLong bounce buffers

* gm-conduit:
 - various stability fixes
 - add spawning scripts for gexec and pbs

* mpi-conduit:
 - add global environment variable exchange to ensure consistent
   gasnet_getenv() results across nodes
 - merge AMMPI release 0.6
