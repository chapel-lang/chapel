README file for template-conduit
================================

$Revision: 1.13 $

This file contains a template to help implementors get started in implementing a
GASNet conduit. It is not a functioning conduit - merely a "skeleton" with most
of the infrastructure in place so one can start filling in code specific to the
conduit network.

To use the template:

* Choose a conduit name - pick something relatively short and descriptive

* Copy the template-conduit directory to conduitname-conduit

* Do a global search-and-replace on the files for the following patterns:
  <CONDUITNAME> => your conduit name, all in upper-case
  <conduitname> => your conduit name, all in lower-case
  (be sure not to insert any extraneous space characters around the names)

* Add your new directory to the top-level Makefile.am and any necessary
  configuration/enabling checks to the configure.in script. Ideally conduit
  detection should be fully automated, only requiring interaction from the user
  in cases where required drivers are installed in non-standard places (and not
  in the PATH).  The CONDUIT_BEGIN/CONDUIT_END macros in configure.in should be
  used to add your conduit to the CONDUITS variable when it is enabled.  Please
  refer to the configure.in checks for other conduits as a pattern for how to
  structure your conduit checks.  This includes creating an AM_CONDITIONAL()
  called USE_<CONDUITNAME>_CONDUIT, which should be used to control the
  building of your conduit and any associated libraries in other/. 

* Edit configure.in and update the AC_OUTPUT() call with entries for 
  <conduitname>-conduit/Makefile, <conduitname>-conduit/conduit.mak,
  and any other configure-generated files you create.

* Any new files you add to the conduit must be placed in the 
  "CONDUIT_FILELIST" variable of <conduitname>-conduit/Makefile.am, 
  any new .c files to be compiled into your conduit library must go into
  the CONDUIT_SOURCELIST variable of that same file.
  See <conduitname>-conduit/Makefile.am for comments on controlling other
  aspects of the library build process, such as include paths, etc.
  In general, ANY files you add to the repository (even documentation!)
  MUST appear somewhere in a Makefile.am file or they will be omitted from
  the GASNet distribution. See online documentation for automake for more info.

* Fill in any compilation settings required for GASNet clients and tests using your 
  conduit (eg linker flags and libraries) in <conduitname>-conduit/conduit.mak.in. 

* Start filling in code specific to your conduit
  Several places in the template are marked with ### to indicate a place where
  you must fill in conduit-specific values or code

* If possible, add auto-detection for your network hardware to 
  gasneti_check_portable_conduit() in gasnet_internal.c

* Delete this file (<conduitname>-conduit/README.template) file 

* Fill in conduit documentation in <conduitname>-conduit/README

The template is already setup to use the reference implementation of the
extended API, so you're recommended to start by implementing the core API, then
once that's done you can optionally choose to tune further by dropping in a
conduit-specific implementation of the extended API.

All GASNet developers are required to follow the GASNet coding standards outlined 
in the top-level README. Please take a moment to read and understand these NOW.
It's especially important that you do NOT make trivial and/or non-meaningful 
changes to the code or makefile framework inherited from template-conduit 
(e.g. re-indenting lines, moving code into different files, renaming existing 
identifiers, etc.) as this makes it more difficult to patch your conduit if 
a bug is discovered in template-conduit or a GASNet-wide change is required.
