User Information:
-----------------

smp-conduit provides a single-node loopback GASNet implementation for 
smp or uniprocessor systems lacking network hardware or API's.
It should be extremely portable and run anywhere with a POSIX-like environment.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.

Future work:
------------

===============================================================================

Design Overview:
----------------

All puts/gets are local accesses (with the locality check removed at compile
time), and all AM handlers execute synchronously on the calling thread. Segment
alignment is trivially guaranteed.
