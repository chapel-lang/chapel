//===========================================================================
* Goals of the design:

** 1) Must be asynchronous, with distinct initiation and finalization
calls.

** 2) Must be "suitable" for implementing the UPC collectives.
Specifically, we need to be able to enforce at least the minimum
input/output constraints of the UPC sync_mode.

** 3) Must be suitable for use on all (reasonable) GASNet platforms,
including those with unaligned segments, progress via polling only,
etc.

** 4) Must be suitable for use in hierarchical implementations on
CLUMPS (i.e. pthreaded clients and SysV shared memory bypass inside
GASNet when it's enabled)

** 5) Must be "efficient" in terms of synchronization - for instance
avoid use of a full barrier where point-to-point synchronization is
faster and still sufficient for correctness.  Of course, this goal
will be achieved differently on each platform and the reference
version need not be infinitely tunable.

** 6) Must admit optimizations using likely hardware features where
appropriate (barriers, broadcast, RDMA-atomics).

** 7) Must NOT break any existing GASNet semantics.

** 8) MAY assume that calls which initiate collective calls are, in
fact, collective with calls made in the same order on all participating nodes, in
the same barrier phase. Synchronization calls may happen in different
orders on different nodes, but collectives will never be in-flight
across a barrier notify/wait interval.

** 9) Must allow for address (and related) arguments which are not
"single-valued" in the sense used by the UPC-spec.  For instance, when
implementing the Titanium exchange operation we have an operation
which is similar to a upc_all_gather_all, except that each node knows
only its own source and destination addresses, not the addresses on
the other addresses.  It is reasonable to expect that GASNet can move
the addresses around more efficiently than a network-independent
GASNet client.  (With AMs, GASNet might even move the data w/o ever
moving the addresses.)

** 10) MAY perform "extra" communication and/or computation where
there is some net savings (examples include implementing
upc_all_scatter() with a broadcast and then discarding some of the
data at each node, or use of full barriers where hardware support
makes them superior to pairwise synchronization.)

*** 11) Must be suitable for implementing the collective support
required by Titanium (which may include future extensions to utilize
the new GASNet support) and Co-Array FORTRAN.  Suitability for
implementing the MPI collectives is also valuable, but not crucial.

*** 12) Should provide support for aggregating the message and
synchronization traffic of separate in-flight collectives, both within
the GASNet implementation and with explicit help from the client. For
example, the compiler should be able to transform several source-level
IN_ALLSYNC|OUT_ALLSYNC collectives issued in a row which it determines
to be data-independent into a series of GASNet calls expressing that
all the collectives should be worked on simultaneously - ideally
causing the implementation to piggy-back any data movement together,
and use a single entry and exit barrier for the entire group of
collectives.

*** 13) Should support operating on in-segment and out-of-segment data

*** 14) Should allow extension to variable-contribution data movement
collectives in the future.

*** 15) Should allow extension to team-based collectives in the future.

//===========================================================================
* Collectives and barriers

At present it is not legal for GASNet collectives and barriers to be
outstanding simultaneously.  This means that collectives may not be
initiated between gasnet_barrier_notify() and the following _try() or
_wait(), and collectives initiated before a gasnet_barrier_notify()
call must also be synced before it.

We may relax this constraint in a future specification.


//===========================================================================
* Collectives and handlers

GASNet collectives may not be initiated or synchronized from within AM
handlers.  This constraint will NOT be relaxed.


//===========================================================================
* Handles

All GASNet collective initiation functions will have blocking and
explicit-handle non-blocking versions.  The blocking versions exist
because in some cases hardware support (such as the blocking hardware
barrier in elan) can implement them more efficiently than the trivial
one-liner.  We omit implicit-handle operations because we anticipate
collectives will be used primarily by library authors with the number
of outstanding operations being small and known at compile time, not
by code generators where the number of operations may be potentially
large and unknown at compile time.

For many reasons we desire to have a handle type which is distinct
from the gasnet_handle_t used for Extended API.  For the moment I'm
assuming a gasnet_coll_* prefix for functions.  So we introduce
"gasnet_coll_handle_t" and "GASNET_COLL_INVALID_HANDLE" to the GASNet
specification.  Meanings are mostly analogous to the existing explicit
handle, including:
  + A handle has per-thread scope and must be synced by the same thread
    which initiated it.
  + A non-blocking collective may return GASNET_COLL_INVALID_HANDLE
    to indicate the operation was completed synchronously.
  + The invalid handle is all zero bits.
  + A handle is "dead" once it has been successfully synced and may
    not be used in future synchronization operations.

//===========================================================================
* Synchronization modes

In order to efficiently implement the UPC collectives, the GASNet
collectives will include the same nine sync modes that are described
in the UPC collectives specification (though names and binary
representations need not follow UPC).  To keep the synchronization
calls lightweight, the synchronization mode will be passed to the
initiation function, but not to the synchronization function.

Here, using the UPC naming, are the three input sync modes given in
terms of GASNet semantics:

+ IN_NOSYNC: All data movement may begin on any GASNet node as soon as
any node has entered the collective initiation function.  This is
sufficient synchronization when, for instance, no input data has been
modified in the current barrier phase.

+ IN_MYSYNC: Each block of data movement may begin as soon as both its
source and destination nodes have entered the collective initiation
function.  This is sufficient synchronization when, for instance, all
modification to the input data in the current barrier phase (if any) was
done locally.

+ IN_ALLSYNC: Data movement may begin only when all nodes have entered
the collective initiation function.  This is potentially the most costly
synchronization, and is necessary when remote modification of input
data (via a put) is possible in the current barrier phase.

Here are the three output sync modes, with the corresponding GASNet
semantics:

+ OUT_NOSYNC: The sync of a collective handle can succeed at any time
so long as the last thread to sync does not do so until all data
movement has completed.  This is sufficient synchronization when no
output data will be consumed in the current barrier phase.

+ OUT_MYSYNC: The sync of a collective handle can succeed as soon as
all data movement has completed to and from local data areas
specified in the call (note that movement to or from buffers
internal to the implementation and local to the node might still be
taking place, for instance in tree-based broadcasts).  This is
sufficient when, for instance, output data will be consumed only
locally (if at all) in the current barrier phase.

+ OUT_ALLSYNC: The sync of a collective handle can succeed as soon as
all data movement has completed to and from all data areas specified
in the call.  This is weaker than a full barrier, since the equivalent
of a zero-byte broadcast is sufficient.  This synchronization mode is
potentially the most costly, and is necessary when output data may be
consumed remotely (via a get) in the current barrier phase.

In the presence of partial information (see Partial Information,
below) the descriptions above "all data areas specified in the call"
means the union of the information available from all nodes.


+ _OUT_ALLSYNC -> implies all buffers are safe for reuse.
+ _OUT_MYSYNC  -> implies local buffers are reusable
+ _OUT_NOSYNC  -> implies no specific buffers are reusable,
                  until the last thread enters the next
                  collective (barrier included)


//===========================================================================
* Bulk vs. non-bulk data reuse

Consistent with the VIS (Vector, Indexed and Strided) interface, the
collectives are specified only for "bulk" data lifetimes.  This means
that if the client reads or writes source or destination memory areas
between the initiation and synchronization of that memory, the results
are undefined.  The same applies for meta-data passed by reference, such
as vectors of addresses to the multi-address interfaces.

As noted in "Synchronization Modes" the point at which
the memory (as opposed to the collective operation) is considered
synchronized depends on the synchronization mode.

+ _OUT_ALLSYNC: memory in all participating images is synchronized when the
collective operation is synchronized in any image.

+ _OUT_MYSYNC: memory in each participating image is synchronized when the
collective operation is synchronized by that image.

+ _OUT_NOSYNC: memory is synchronized when the collective operation is
synchronized in all participating images.


//===========================================================================
* Bulk vs. non-bulk alignment

The GASNet collectives for data movement do not assume any data
alignment (consistent with UPC and with the GASNet-VIS interface).

The computational collectives (reduce and prefix_reduce)
requires alignment correct for the operation's data type.


//===========================================================================
* Synchronization calls

We'll support the same family of explicit handle try and wait calls as
for the gets and puts.  See the section "Synchronization Modes" for a
description of what success of a sync call implies.

void gasnet_coll_wait_sync(gasnet_coll_handle_t handle);
int gasnet_coll_try_sync(gasnet_coll_handle_t handle);

void gasnet_coll_wait_sync_all(gasnet_coll_handle_t *handles, size_t n);
int gasnet_coll_try_sync_all(gasnet_coll_handle_t *handles, size_t n);

void gasnet_coll_wait_sync_some(gasnet_coll_handle_t *handles, size_t n);
int gasnet_coll_try_sync_some(gasnet_coll_handle_t *handles, size_t n);

Synchronization of a GASNet collective is NOT itself a collective
operation and the returns from the synchronization calls on individual
nodes may occur as early as permitted by the sync mode argument passed
to the collective initiation function.  Specifically, synchronization
calls need not occur in the same order on all nodes. 


//===========================================================================
* Metadata lifetime

Where arguments are passed by reference to the collective initiation
functions, the argument values must remain unchanged between the
initiation and synchronization of the collective operation on the node
owning the referenced memory.  If this meta data lies in the GASNet
segment, clients should take care to prevent remote modification of
the meta-data, especially since a remote node may sync before the local
node has finished with the meta-data.


//===========================================================================
* Progress

We expect the non-blocking collectives to make progress in
gasnet_AMPoll() or the sync call as the worst case.  A separate
section addresses how this will interface with the conduit
implementation to make progress in gasnet_AMPoll() or asynchronously
when possible.


//===========================================================================
* Collectives and threads

Collectives must be initiated in the same order on all participating nodes.
To execute a collective operation a collective initiation function
must be called on all nodes by all "images" (threads that have called
gasnet_coll_init()) and the handles each thread receives must be synced
by the same thread.

The type gasnet_coll_handle_t specifies a handle which may be
synchronized only by the thread to which it was returned when initiating
the collective  (ie the gasnet_coll_handle_t handle is node-specific
and thread-specific.)

//===========================================================================
* Data segment

We want to optimize implementation in cases where the source and
destination of the data movement collectives are in the GASNet
segment.  However, we do not wish to require extra copies by the client
to achive this.  Therefore, we allow the client to
specify the following flags

 + GASNET_COLL_DST_IN_SEGMENT -> If set, this bit is an assertion by the client
   that the destination address argument(s) to this collective
   operation lie in the GASNet segment.

 + GASNET_COLL_SRC_IN_SEGMENT -> If set, this bit is an assertion by the client
   that the source address argument(s) to this collective operation
   lie in the GASNet segment.

It is an error to set either of these flag bits when any portion of
the corresponding memory lies outside the GASNet segment.


//===========================================================================
* "Single-valued" arguments

To implement things like Titanium's Exchange operation, we want a
mechanism to deal with the case that not all nodes know all addresses.
One approach would be to require the client to move addresses around
to construct a call to the GASNet collectives which is "single-valued"
in the sense used in the specification of the UPC collectives.
However, there exist a number of implementation choices which would
allow the GASNet conduit to perform collectives with only partial
information on each node, and to do so more efficiently than having
the client perform a gather_all just to collect the single-valued
arguments.  We also want to be able to use the fact that a client
implementing the UPC collectives *will* provide us with single-valued
arguments.

The GASNet collectives are *NOT* limited to being called with
single-valued arguments.  We will have flag values indicating if
address arguments to the collective initiation function are given
in the UPC or Titanium style.

 + *_LOCAL -> The arguments provided by the local initiation call
 include correct local addresses, but not correct remote addresses.

 + *_SINGLE -> The arguments provided by the initiation calls on all
 nodes include correct local and remote addresses, and they agree.

In the future we may wish to add *_GLOBAL, which would mix freely with
other nodes specifying *_LOCAL.  This would allow some nodes to know
all addresses while others knew only local ones.  We have no consumers
for this at present, and thus don't specify it yet.
 
If any node calls with the _SINGLE flags, then all nodes must do so,
and all addresses must agree across all nodes.

The 'nbytes', 'root' (for broadcast, scatter and gather) and
synchronization mode must agree across all nodes regardless of the
_LOCAL, _SINGLE flag.


//===========================================================================
* Number outstanding

There exists some concern that implementing synchronization using PUTS
rather than AMs may require bounding the number of collective ops which
are outstanding on the network and/or forcing ops to be completed (inside
the conduit) in the order issued.  It has been determined that none of
this should be visible to the client:

The interface will expose a limit of no less than 2^16-1. The implementation
may internally use back-pressure flow control at a smaller limit, but
initiation calls must always independently make progress without any
synchronization action by the client on any node.

Sync calls must be non-collective to support a number of important
paradigms (eg spawn many MYSYNC collectives and compute on
the result as trysync reports them to be complete). It's not even
clear what it would mean to require a collective try sync on a MYSYNC
or NOSYNC operation (where some nodes succeed and others fail).
However, internally completing the collectives in order is acceptable
when it's necessary. That still provides significantly more flexibility
to the client than forcing the syncs to be collective.

//===========================================================================
* Multiple Addresses

To support a non-pthread UPC client with aligned segments requires the
simplest form of addressing.  Because the segments are aligned and
shared arrays are aligned within their segments, a single address
describes the data placement on all participating nodes.  However, with unaligned
segments one needs at least one address per node.  To perform direct
data placement with multiple threads per node one needs multiple
addresses, with the alignment of segments determining if you need one
for every application thread or as many addresses as threads per node.
For Titanium clients we have the added wrinkle that a given node has
no knowledge of the addresses on the others.  Here is a summary of the
five distinct cases that have been identified:
 +  UPC or CAF w/ aligned segments, 1 thread/node
    (or multi-threaded w/ hierarchical data movement)
 +  UPC or CAF w/ unaligned segments, 1 thread/node
    (or multi-threaded w/ hierarchical data movement)
 +  UPC or CAF multi-threaded w/ direct data placement
 +  Titanium, 1 thread/node
    (or multi-threaded w/ hierarchical data movement)
 +  Ti multi-threaded w/ direct data placement

The current proposal allows for all of these cases by offering two
types of interface - one taking scalar address arguments and one
taking lists of addresses.

//===========================================================================
* Teams:

Note that the major issues with adding teams to UPC are related to
pointer arithmetic and memory allocation, neither of which affect
GASNet.  Therefore, the GASNet collectives are designed to be
team-ready immediately (even if we delay implementation until we have
a client).  Therefore, all collectives take a team handle as the first
argument.  GASNET_TEAM_ALL is predefined and is analogous to
MPI_COMM_WORLD.  Looking for GASNET_TEAM_ALL we can identify non-team
collectives at compile time and avoid paying any runtime cost for the
team generality when it is not needed.

To avoid deadlock when using team collectives, a client must follow
certain ordering constraints.  Informally, we require that for any
pair of collectives all images which participate in both must agree on
their ordering.  Formally this may be expressed as follows.

  For any collective X let Participants(X) denote the set of images which
  are members of the corresponding team.  For non-team collectives,
  Participants() is the set of all images across all the GASNet nodes.

  For image I, and collectives X and Y, let Precedes_I(X,Y) be a
  predicate true when X != Y and collective X is initiated before
  collective Y on the node hosting image I.

  For all collectives X and Y:
    For all images I and J in Intersection(Participants(X), Participants(Y)):
      Precedes_I(X,Y) = Precedes_J(X,Y).

Note there is no ambiguity when X==Y or I==J

An interface for the creation of teams is still an open issue.

We also need to think about what thread serialization we require 
for calling collective initiation functions when images on a node participate
in teams that do not encompass all the local images. Specifically, 
requiring client-level serialization for two team-collective
initiation calls where the sets of locally participating images are disjoint
can easily lead to deadlock, even for the simple case of blocking ALL/ALL
collectives (because the collective ordering property does not apply across
disjoint teams, so different nodes may invert the call ordering between
independent teams).

//===========================================================================
END OF NORMATIVE STUFF (MOSTLY AGREED TO)
START OF OPEN ISSUES
//===========================================================================

* OPEN ISSUE: Variable contributions

What about calls where each node may contribute a different sized
source to a gather or gather_all, or different sized dest to a scatter
(with a proper constraint on the sums).  This would be a natural(?)
"v" extension to the current two-flavor proposal.


* OPEN ISSUE: Progress

In-flight collectives should be guaranteed to make progress, provided
all nodes poll occasionally. Allowing them to make progress
independent of polling activity would be nice, but is not a firm
requirement.

Non-blocking initiation calls are collective, so in some
implementations (esp with IN_ALLSYNC) they may stall waiting for all
nodes to arrive. This specifically means that it would be an error for
a GASNet client to construct a dependency cycle where node A stalls
before reaching the collective initiation, waiting for the result of
some action that will be taken by node B when it exits the collective
initiation. We need to formalize this requirement in the spec.


* OPEN ISSUE: Co-Array FORTRAN (CAF)

The CAF "spec" does not provide any library or intrinsic collective
interfaces.  However, the FORTRAN 95 array syntax is available and MIGHT
express the collective operations (minus synchronization) in a manner
that the compiler could easily translate into gasnet_coll_*() calls.

Unfortunately, the lack of a defined interface encourages the calls like
Exchange to be hand coded with staggered indexes to avoid communications
bottle-necks.  Such hand-optimized collectives are NOT good candidates
for automatic translation by the complier.  This fact is noted in an
October 2003 paper from the group at Rice, which also state that they are
working on a specification for CAF intrinsics for collective
communication.

CAF permits team syncs and team collectives.  We need to look at that
when trying to extend GASNet for teams.


* OPEN ISSUE: Computational collectives (reduce and prefix reduce).

** Data lifetime and alignment

Like the other collectives we want bulk lifetimes for both data and
metadata.  Unlike the other collective operations, we require that the
data be properly aligned for its type.

At present the GASNet spec says that AM medium payload will have an
alignment of 8-bytes or higher.  However, we don't know if some
hypothetical system could require a higher alignment for some data
type of interest (128-bit types?).  Therefore the library implementation
should be parameterized by a constant value 
GASNET_DATA_ALIGNMENT which gives the alignment enforced by the
computation collectives.  This value will default to 8 (the AM
Medium payload alignment), but at configuration time this could
be increased on a given platform having stronger requirements.

** Client-provided (prefix) reduction function.

GASNet computational collectives use an untyped interface in which the
client provides the number and size of elements, but not a data type.
GASNet has no built-in reductions for particular data types or
operations.

GASNet does not assume a single-image environment and thus the address
of the same function may differ across nodes.  Therefore the GASNet
implementation of the computational collectives is constrained to only
invoke a function pointer on the same node which provided it.
Functions are referenced by a handle type to hide this issue.

Like AM handlers, GASNet does not ensure that the client-provided
function is executed in the context of any particular thread, and may
legally execute it in a thread internal to the implementation.  GASNet
also does not provide any serialization of these function invocations.
However, the client does have control over whether these functions can
be called from handler context.

There is currently nothing in the UPC spec that would prohibit the
app-provided function from accessing remote memory, or UPC thread-specific
values/locations such as MYTHREAD or global-scope TLD.  Therefore the library does
not evaluate callback functions from AM handler context or conduit-internal
thread unless we have
assurance from the client that it is safe to do so.  For this purpose,
we include GASNET_COLL_AMSAFE flag, which may be included in the
'flags' argument when registering a function (see below).  Inclusion
of this flag is a hint to the GASNet implementation which permits it
to evaluate the client-provided function (reduction, prefix-reduction,
or comparison) in an AM context and/or using conduit-internal threads, 
which the implementation must never do without this flag. 
More specifically, all callbacks registered without the GASNET_COLL_AMSAFE flag
are guaranteed to only run synchronously on an application thread 
in a context where it is legal to invoke any (non-collective) GASNet functions.

In the case of blocked and block
cyclic layouts one may potentially benefit from an interface which can
pass an entire block.  This interface has the advantage of
placing the function call outside the loops.  This means that we
should be able to get compiler optimization of the inner reduction
loops.  This includes vectorization on some platforms, and things like
loop unrolling, software pipelining and SIMD floating point on others.

It is explicitly undefined how many times the callback functions will
be invoked on behalf of a given collective or on which nodes it will
be invoked - specifically, the callback may be invoked to calculate 
partial or redundant results, resulting in the reduction operator 
globally being evaluated a total number of times which exceeds the
count one might expect from a naive translation of the reduction 
operation (ie more than total_num_elements - 1 evaluations).
It is additionally undefined which data locations may be passed as 
input and output arguments to the reduction function - they may 
include a mix of references to the client data areas and intermediate
buffers which may or may not reside in the GASNet segment.


We keep a single signature for both commutative and non-commutative
operators and for reduction and prefix-reduction, so that we can pass
the function pointers through the same call.  Note that a prefix
reduction function, when called for exactly one output argument is
semantically identical to a reduction.  This provides important
freedom to the GASNet implementation of a prefix reduction, which can
freely perform reductions of intermediate results while only requiring
the client to provide a single prefix-reduce function, and not a
distinct function for reduction only.

We can easily allow for full generality of the implementation by
making no assumptions about the number of partial reductions which
might be present at any stage of the computation.  We may have zero or
more operands which do not have corresponding outputs and will always
have one or more operands which do have corresponding outputs.  In
the case of a non-commutative prefix reduction, we know that the
operands which have corresponding outputs will always lie to the right
of those without.  In the case of a reduction we have exactly one
output, but need not associate it with any particular input.  Thus we
require all client callbacks to 
support an arbitrary number of left-hand and a non-zero number of
right-hand operands.  This leads to a simple interface with two
pointers to vectors of operands and two scalars giving the vector
lengths.  A third vector of outputs is also required, and will have
the same length as the right-hand operand vector.  This is the natural
choice for a prefix-reduction since there are never "optional"
right-hand operands.

To allow client freedom in implementing (prefix) reduction functions,
we pass the size of the data elements, the commutativity and a
client-provided integer argument from the initiation function through
to the invocation of the client-provided function.

Following the ideas above leads to this prototype:

/* For flags to the reduce_fn: */
#define GASNET_COLL_NONCOMM		???

typedef void
	(gasnet_coll_reduce_fn)(void *results, size_t result_count,
				const void *left_operands, size_t left_count,
				const void *right_operands,
				size_t elem_size, int flags, int arg);
	results: Output array
		This argument is the address of the space into which the
		result(s) should be written.
	result_count: Result count
		The number of results to be generated.  Since there is
		a one-to-one correspondence between results and
		right-hand operands, this is also the length of the
		'right_operands' array. 

/*** RAJESH: I REALLY DON'T THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS We'll be forced into a function call overhead for every 
             element in the reduction which could be very large****/
    The client may safely assume that a
		callback invoked on behalf of a (non-prefix) reduce function
		will always have result_count == 1. Otherwise, it will be >= 1.

	left_operands: Optional left-hand operand array
		This argument is the address of 0 or more operands which lie
		to the left of those given by the 'right_operands' argument.
		The number of operands in this array is given by the
		'left_count' argument.  If 'left_count' is zero then this
		argument is ignored.
	left_count: Left-hand operand count
		The number of operands in the 'left_operands' array.
		The client may safely assume that a callback invoked on behalf 
		of a (non-prefix) reduce function will always have 
		left_count > 0. No other guarantees are provided.
	right_operands: Right-hand operand array
		This argument is the address of 1 or more operands which lie
		to the right of those given by the 'left_operands' argument.
		The number of operands in this array is given by the
		'result_count' argument.
	elem_size: Size of the operand and result elements.
		This argument gives the size of the data elements
		which are to be manipulated.
	flags: Flag values
		This argument gives information about the operation and
		is composed of a bitwise or of values.
		The value of 'flags' will include GASNET_COLL_NONCOMM
		if and only if the client passed this same flag to the
		gasnet_coll_init() function when registering this function.
		The remaining bits of 'flags' are reserved for future use and
		the client must not assume they will have any particular
		value.
	arg: Client-supplied argument
		This is the one argument passed into the gasnet_coll_init()
		function by the client when registering this function.

Here is an example for a reduction (summation of integers), which takes
(slight) advantage of commutativity to start with the right-hand operands,
knowing that they must be non-empty:

void summation_example( void *results, size_t result_count,
			const void *left_operands, size_t left_count,
			const void *right_operands,
			size_t elem_size, int flags, int arg)
{
	int *left = (int *)left_operands;
	int *right = (int *)right_operands;
	int sum;
	int i;
	
	sum = right[0];
	for (i = 1; i < right_count; ++i) sum += right[i];
	for (i = 0; i < left_count;  ++i) sum += left[i];

	*(int *)results = sum;
}

Here is an example where we call a non-commutative function on doubles
to perform a prefix reduction.  Note that the application-provided
function is passed "over" gasnet in the 'arg' which must be an index into
a table, rather than an actual pointer.
		
void noncomm_prefix_example(void *results, size_t result_count,
			    const void *left_operands, size_t left_count,
			    const void *right_operands,
			    size_t elem_size, int flags, int arg)
{
	double (*func)(double, double) = my_fn_tbl[arg];
	double *output = (double *)results;
	double *left = (double *)left_operands;
	double *right = (double *)right_operands;
	double tmp;
	int i;

	/* The computation of the first result will depend on the presence
	 * or absence of partial reductions from "left neighbors". */
	if (left_count > 0) {
		/* Accumulate one or more partial reductions */
		tmp = left[0];
		for (i = 1; i < left_count; ++i) {
			tmp = (*func)(tmp, left[i]);
		}

		tmp = (*func)(tmp, right[0]);
	} else {
		tmp = right[0];
	}
	
	/* Compute and store all the prefix reductions corresponding
	   to the right-hand operands */
	output[0] = tmp;
	for (i = 1; i < right_count; ++i) {
		tmp = output[i] = (*func)(tmp, right[i]);
	}
}

From these examples, one can see how this choice of interface can
enable vectorization.

** UPC-imposed complications (data layout)

It is not hard to deal with cyclic, block and block-cyclic
layouts of data by implementing block-cyclic and allowing the other
two to fall out as the two natural extremes.  Using the generality
allowed by the multiple-address data-movement collectives is enough to
describe a block layout even for unaligned segments and multiple heaps
per node.  The inclusion of a scalar "element size" is already assumed
by the choice of a untyped interface.  The addition of one more
scalar, "block size" allows us to express the block-cyclic layout.  A
value blk_sz==1 conveys pure-cyclic.  The UPC interfaces have
blk_size==0 to convey indefinite layout and that seems appropriate
here as well, but more on that below.

If UPC required phase==0 affinity=node0 for the source of a reduction
(and dest of a prefix reduction), then indefinite layout would be the
only corner case to deal with.  However, the UPC collective spec
allows arbitrary alignment of the input and output arrays.  The first
elements of the input need not have affinity to thread 0, nor is it
required to have a phase of 0.  On top of that, the prefix reduction
does not require the input and output arrays to have the same alignment.
This requires at least some level of generality in the interface.
Rather than go to the full generality of variable contributions to deal
with this, we can add just one more scalar.

Let us assume we have an interface which allows expression of a
block-cyclic layout, including an element size, number of elements per
node (one scalar value), block size and the addresses of the
contributions on each node.  Then to deal with the non-aligned case we
can pass a block-cyclic "bounding box" plus two additional scalars:
the index of the first element to use (as input or output), and the
total number of elements to use.  The second of these need not be a
new argument, but can instead can replace the element count which
previously described the full "bounding box".  The number of elements
in the bounding box can be easily computed if it is ever needed.

So, to express the input array requires the following 5-tuple:
  (elem_sz, elem_count, blk_sz, offset, address(es))
Where the addresses have the same freedom of expression as used in the
data-movement collectives.  When specifying the output array for a
prefix reduction the elem_size and elem_count must be the same, so we
only need the other three: blk_sz, offset and the address(es).

Note that UPC specifies the prefix reduction to have the same blk_sz
but allows for a different starting offset (affinity and phase).  I
propose to give gasnet the additional generality of different block
sizes.  Once indefinite layout is accounted for (below), this will
allow prefix_reduce+gather and scatter+prefix_reduce to become single
prefix reductions. [ Note: UPC no longer allows this generality. ]

To allow for reblocking indefinite layout is something we need to
express cleanly.  As in UPC, we can use blk_sz=0 to express the fact
that a given src or dst array has indefinite layout.  However, we
would seem to need an additional argument to indicate to which node
the array has affinity.  However, the offset needed for block-cyclic
arrays is not needed for its original purpose.  Therefore, the
"offset" would be an image number for the indefinite case and would
remain an element count for the other cases.

** Commutativity/Associativity

In the UPC spec it is stated that all reduction ops are assumed
associative and all are assumed commutative except UPC_NONCOMM_FUNC.
The associativity assumption is consistent with MPI, which urges
implementers to evaluate things in a predetermined order so that
multiple runs produce identical results (with the same node/image 
layout), even in the presence of floating-point roundoff.  I would 
reiterate this advice as advice to GASNet implementers as well.

GASNet provides the GASNET_COLL_NONCOMM flag so the client may
indicate that the client-provided (prefix) reduction function is
non-commutative.  The default, when this flag is not passed, is to
assume a commutative operator.


** Registration of functions

Because we cannot assume a single image environment we must deal with
the possibility that a client-provided function may not have the same
address on all nodes.  To deal with this issue the function for a
computational collective is passed as an integer valued handle.
Similar to AM handler ids, these handles
provide a mechanism to ensure that all the nodes can unambiguously
refer to the same function on different nodes.  Additionally, by
creating these handles before they are referenced, we can safely
invoke functions on nodes that have not yet entered an IN_NOSYNC
collective.

To ensure that these handles are instantiated on all nodes prior to
their use, the creation of these handles must be collective.  We
envision the set of client-provided functions as those defined by some
language or library specification.  Therefore registration is static,
performed in the gasnet_coll_init() call.  These handles are "global".
Once registered on a given node, the same handle can be used by any
thread on that node and can be safely passed between nodes.

The same handle table is used for the functions passed to reduction,
and prefix reduction collectives.  This is possible because the
reduction and prefix reduction take functions with the same signature.

Some functions are safe to call from an AM handler context while
others are not.  Some reduction functions are commutative while others
may not be.  Both of these properties are considered to be features of
the functions, rather than the collective calls in which they
are used.  Therefore there are flags to the registration of a function.
The corresponding flags are GASNET_COLL_AMSAFE and
GASNET_COLL_NONCOMM.

Unlike the registration of AM handlers, we are not permitting the
client to specify independent handle values.  The handles are simply the position
of each function in the handler table, and are not explicitly returned
from the registration operation.

To implement application-provided functions requires a level of
indirection.  Because one cannot typically know how many distinct
functions will be invoked, the GASNet-client will need to manage a
table.  If one imagines keeping a simple FIFO or LRU cache of the
application-provided functions, then an index into that cache can be
used as the single-valued argument to the GASNet collective.  Ensuring
that the cache entry is set correctly on all nodes before first use
can be as simple as promoting IN_NOSYNC to IN_MYSYNC for any
collective call which references a newly installed entry.  Note that
in this scenario the GASNet-client will also need to track in-flight
collectives that use app-provided functions to ensure that a cache
entry is never evicted while in use (unbounded tables would eliminate
eviction, but may still be undesirable). Once GASNet and UPC grow 
real teams, this client table will likely need to be managed per-team.


* OPEN ISSUE: Teams

We need a representation for a team.  Once constructed, we want a team
to be an immutable object.  Thus an opaque handle of some sort is
appropriate.  We will need an unambiguous way for the implementation
to refer to the teams on the wire.  Therefore we anticipate providing
handles which will have the same bitwise representation across all
team members. (Note that this does not prevent the same bitwise value
from simultaneously denoting another team with a disjoint node
membership; a property that allows the id to be generated by a
reduction over the member nodes if desired.) Either way, we need to be
clear about what guarantees (if any) are provided to the client regarding the
team handles - specifically, can they safely be passed across threads and/or
nodes, and can they be compared for equality to test team equality.

We can imagine needing to access a team in at least three different
ways.  The simplest is to ask "does image I belong to team T?"  With a
vector of image numbers we can perform this test in O(|T|) time, or in
O(log(|T|)) if the vector is sorted.  If we have a bitmap
representation then we can perform the is_member() test in O(1) time.

Another is a potential need to iterate over the members of a team.
For a team with |T| << P, we'd like to perform the iteration in
O(|T|).  The image vector implementation allows for a O(|T|)
implementation of iteration (total time for all |T| iterations).

We may also need a mapping between global image number and a "rank"
within a team.  The image-vector representation makes the rank->image
mapping trivial.  The inverse mapping will require either O(I)
additional storage to perform the mapping in O(1) time, or could be
done by binary search within the image vector on O(log(|T|)) time.

By using an opaque identifier for teams, we can internally keep both
the image vector representation and a bitmap (and the image->rank
mapping array if desired).


//===========================================================================
END OF OPEN ISSUES
START OF CURRENT PROPOSAL
//===========================================================================

There are two flavors of interface to each collective.  The simple
addressing case moves an equal amount of contiguous data to or from
each node, with the exception of the root node in the asymmetric
collectives (broadcast, scatter and gather).  This type of interface
takes a single src address and a single dst address.  This is suitable
for the case of UPC collectives with aligned segments (and a single
UPC thread per node or hierarchical movement of data for multiple
threads), and also suitable for Titanium-style collectives in which
each node may have a distinct source or destination, but lacks
knowledge of the other addresses.

The second flavor is the multiple-address interfaces, having an "m"
suffix.  Like the gasnet_{get,put}i() family of interfaces, the
multiple-address interfaces take lists of sources and destinations.
This allows for the cases not covered by the basic interface.  If a
UPC runtime has unaligned segments, then the list could specify
exactly one address per node with the freedom for them to differ.  If
there are multiple UPC or Titanium threads in the address space of a
single GASNet node, then the lists could provide multiple addresses
per node to avoid the need for hierarchical movement of data.  Note
that this interface is designed for a static number of images, such as
one per language-level thread, and not for varying the size of the
contribution from each node dynamically.

Common to all these interfaces is the presence of either
GASNET_COLL_LOCAL or GASNET_COLL_SINGLE in the flags argument.  In the
SINGLE case we have UPC-style arguments in which the addresses are
known (and thus passed in) on all nodes.  In the LOCAL case we have
Titanium-style arguments in which only the local addresses are known,
and passed in.

Note that when SINGLE is given, then all arguments are "single valued"
providing identical information on all nodes (for arrays the contents
of the arrays must be identical, not their addresses).  When LOCAL is
given the address arguments may differ among the nodes while all
remaining arguments are "single valued".  For instance the nodes must
all agree on the "root" of a broadcast, scatter or gather, even though
only the root node will provided its address.  Of course all nodes
must agree on the nbytes and the flags.  Operation of any collective
in which the arguments fail to agree as required will be undefined.
In the event of such a user error, high-quality implementations are
encouraged to issue an explanatory fatal error message if debugging
is enabled or if checking for agreement does not require additional
communication.

For the multiple-address interfaces, there is additional metadata
required to indicate how many images exist on each node.  Since these
interfaces are designed for this metadata to be static, it is provided
exactly once, through the gasnet_coll_init() function.  This function
must be called by clients before they may invoke any other gasnet_coll_*
function (even if they never use the multiple-address interfaces).  It
is therefore a collective operation, called by all nodes in the same
order (always first) among collectives.  It is also subject to the
constraint that the arguments agree across nodes.  Unlike other
collectives the _init call MUST be made collectively by every thread
on a node.
This is a blocking call.  This function may be called at most
once by each thread and may only be called between gasnet_attach() and
gasnet_exit().

The 'images' argument to gasnet_coll_init() is an array of gasnet_image_t's,
having exactly gasnet_nodes() elements.  The ith element of this array
indicates the number of images present on node i.  Images are
analogous to language-level threads in all the clients we envision,
but this need not be the case.  The images are always given in
"node-major" order, meaning that the blocks of data in a gather
operation (for instance) include all the images from node 0, followed
by all the images from node 1, etc. (consistent with the default
thread layout of all the runtimes we examined).  All elements of the
'images' array must be non-zero.  For use in the descriptions that
follow, define NImages := SUM(i=0..gasnet_nodes(), images[i]).
NImages must be less than or equal to SSIZE_MAX (as defined by POSIX).
A NULL pointer for the 'images' argument indicates a single image
per GASNet node.  In a GASNET_SEQ configuration, 'images' must be NULL.

If 'images' is not NULL, then 'my_image' argument to gasnet_coll_init()
gives the image number of the calling thread.  Otherwise it is ignored.

There is a 'flag' value of GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE which can be used to
request that consecutive non-blocking collective initiation calls be
aggregated into a single collective operation with a single handle.
It is illegal to pass GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE to a blocking collective
initiation call.

To simplify the definitions, we'll consider a single collective to be
a trivial one-element aggregate.  A collective initiation call is the
First member of an aggregate if either the previous collective
initiation call for the current team did not have GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE in the
'flags', or if it is the first collective initiation call for the current team.
A collective initiation call is the Last member of an aggregate if it does not
have GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE in the 'flags'.

With these definitions, a sequence of initiation calls all without the
GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE flag are each trivially the First and Last
members of their own aggregates and each has a distinct handle.  A
sequence of initiation calls on a given team with the GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE
flag set form a multiple-member aggregate, together with the first following
call without GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE.

Use of aggregation is semantically equivalent to what an nbi access region
does for gets and puts.  Specifically, aggregation of a series of calls
does not provide any semantics that are not provided by the same sequence
of calls and gasnet_coll_wait_sync_all() or gasnet_coll_try_sync_all().
If the inputs of one operation overlap the outputs of another in the
aggregate then the result is undefined, just as in the absence of
aggregation.  Furthermore, as all of the members of an aggregate by
definition are in-flight for overlapping time intervals, the
synchronization flags do not enforce synchronization between operations
within an aggregate - only between each individual collective operation and
surrounding, non-overlapping activities.

The handle returned by any collective initiation call with
GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE in the flags is undefined.  If a client attempts
to sync on a handle returned by such a call then the behavior is
undefined.  If the Last member of an aggregate is a non-blocking
initiation call, then it will return a valid handle, successful
synchronization of which indicates that all members of the aggregate
have completed to the extent required by their synchronization flags.
If the Last member of an aggregate is a blocking call then it will not
return until all members of the aggregate have completed to the extent
required by their synchronization flags.

GASNet non-blocking collectives have bulk data lifetime semantics
regardless of the use of aggregation.  The lifetime of any given
buffer starts with the initiation call describing that buffer, and is
not deferred until the Last member of the aggregate.

It is permitted to make other GASNet calls between the First and Last
calls of an aggregate, excepting those calls that would be prohibited
even in the absence of aggregation, such as the gasnet_barrier_*
calls.  However, since some implementations of aggregation may delay
the start of communication until the Last member is seen, use of any
potentially time-consuming operations between the First and Last
collective initiation calls is discouraged.

Note to implementers:
The description above allows for an implementation which does nothing
but aggregate the handles in the spirit of an nbi access region,
starting communications just as it would in the absence of
aggregation.

/* Argument conventions for data movement collectives:
 * In the prototypes that follow the argument names are used
 * consistently, so the following definitions apply to all arguments
 * with the given name:
 *
 * team: Team handle
 *	This argument is an opaque handle of type gasnet_team_handle_t.
 *	This provides for an extension of the GASNet collectives to
 *	support teams.  Presently this argument must have the value
 *	GASNET_TEAM_ALL.
 * flags: Flags
 * 	The value of this argument must be equal across all callers or
 *	the behavior is undefined.
 *	This argument supplies flags which determine how the operation
 *	will be performed.  This includes information about the
 *	synchronization required and the scope of addresses.
 *	Input synchronization flags are:
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_IN_NOSYNC: All data movement may begin on any
 *	  GASNet node as soon as any caller has entered the collective
 *	  initiation function.
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_IN_MYSYNC: Data movement in or out of the client memory
 *	  of a given image may begin no earlier than the entry to
 *	  the collective initiation function by that image.
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_IN_ALLSYNC: Data movement may begin only when
 *        all participating images have entered the collective 
 *        initiation function.
 *	Output synchronization flags are:
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_OUT_NOSYNC: The sync of a collective handle may
 *	  succeed at any time so long as the last thread to sync does
 *	  not do so until all data movement has completed.
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_OUT_MYSYNC: The sync of a collective handle may
 *	  succeed as soon as all data movement has completed to and from
 *	  local client data areas specified in the call (note that movement to
 *	  or from buffers internal to the implementation and local to the
 *	  node might still be taking place, for instance in tree-based
 *	  broadcasts).
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_OUT_ALLSYNC: The sync of a collective handle may
 *	  succeed as soon as all data movement has completed to and from
 *	  all client data areas specified in the call.  This is weaker than a
 *	  full barrier.  For instance, the equivalent of a zero-byte
 *	  broadcast is sufficient synchronization in the case of a rooted
 *	  operation (broadcast, scatter and gather).
 *	Addressing scope flags are:
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_SINGLE: This indicates UPC-type addressing
 *	  in which every caller provides addresses for the source(s) and
 *	  destination(s) on all participating images, and these arguments
 *	  agree.
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_LOCAL: This indicates Titanium-type addressing
 *	  in which each caller provides only the local address(es).
 *      Defaults:
 *	There are no default values for these three categories of flags.
 *	The client must provide exactly one flag value from each of the
 *	three categories above.
 *	Aggregation:
 *	If present, the flag GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE indicates that a
 *	sequence of non-blocking collective initiation calls should be
 *	aggregated together into a operation with a single handle.
 *	GASNet Segment:
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_DST_IN_SEGMENT: If present, this bit is an assertion
 *        by the client that the destination address argument(s) to this
 *        collective operation lie in the GASNet segment.
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_SRC_IN_SEGMENT: If present, this bit is an assertion
 *        by the client that the source address argument(s) to this
 *        collective operation lie in the GASNet segment.
 *
 * nbytes: Byte count
 *	This is the number of bytes to be transfered per source block.
 *      The value must be greater than zero.
 *      The value of this argument must be equal across all callers or
 *	the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * {dst,src}image: Destination/Source image.
 *      This argument specifies the root image of an asymmetric collective
 *	operation: Broadcast, Scatter or Gather.
 * 	The value of this argument must be equal across all callers or
 *	the behavior is undefined.  In a GASNET_SEQ configuration, the
 *	image number is identical to a node number.  Otherwise, the
 *	image numbering is the one established by the 'my_image' arguments
 *	to gasnet_coll_init().
 *
 * {dst,src}: Destination (Source) address.
 *	For Broadcast and Scatter the source address is only applicable
 *	to the root image/node.  For the Gather operation the destination
 *	address is only applicable to the root image/node.  For the remaining
 *	operations both destination and source apply on all images.
 *
 * 	In the SINGLE case this argument is given an identical value
 *	by all callers.  This value is used as the destination (source)
 *	address on all images where the argument is applicable.  Where a
 *	given argument is not applicable to the given image the identical
 *	value must still be provided.
 *
 *	In the LOCAL case this argument may be passed independent values
 *	by each caller.  Each caller's value is used as it's destination
 *	(source) address where applicable.  Where a given argument is
 *	not applicable to the given caller the argument is ignored.
 *
 * {dst,src}list: Destination (Source) address list.
 * 	In the SINGLE case this argument is an array of NImages addresses.
 *	The contents of this array must be identical across all callers.
 *	The ith address is used as the destination (source) address of the
 *	ith image.  The correspondence between images and GASNet nodes is
 *	the one given by the gasnet_coll_init() call.
 *
 *	In the LOCAL case this argument may be passed independent values
 *	on each node.  On node i, this argument is an array of images[i]
 *	local addresses, where images[] is the argument passed to
 *	gasnet_coll_init().
 *
 *  If the arguments to a multiple-address interface specify data
 *  movement involving two blocks from images coexisting on a 
 *  single node such that the blocks actually overlap in memory,
 *  the behavior is undefined (even if both are source blocks).
 *  Except where otherwise noted, if any of the source areas overlap
 *  any of the destination areas, the behavior is undefined.
 *
 *  The following are the explicit exceptions to the above rule concerning
 *  overlap of source and destination areas, where "identical" means
 *  having the same values of node, address and length.  They have in common
 *  that omitting a copy between matching source and destination blocks
 *  would still result in correct results.
 *  + Broadcast:
 *    The source block may legally be identical to any one of the
 *    destination blocks.
 *  + Scatter, Gather, Gather_all and Exchange:
 *    The i'th block of the source may legally be identical to the
 *    i'th block of the destination.
 *  + Exchange
 *    There are no exceptions for the exchange operation.

 * dstlist, dst_blksz, dst_offset: Destination address(es) (prefix_reducem)
 *	These arguments give the address or addresses of the destination
 *	array for the multiple-address interfaces.  See the descriptions
 *	of the arguments 'srclist', 'src_blksz' and 'src_offset' for the
 *	interpretation of this triplet as a specification of a
 *	distributed array.
 *
 * * Common Arguments
 * team: Team handle
 *	This argument is an opaque handle of type gasnet_team_handle_t.
 *	This provides for an extension of the GASNet collectives to
 *	support teams.  Presently this argument must have the value
 *	GASNET_TEAM_ALL.
 * src: Source address(es)
 *	This argument gives the address or addresses of the source
 *	array for the single-address interfaces.  The array holds
 *	'elem_count' data items, each of size 'elem_size' bytes.  The
 *	layout of elements across the images depend on additional
 *	arguments.  When 'src_blksz' is zero, we have indefinite
 *	layout and all 'elem_count' data elements reside on a single
 *	image, given by 'src_offset'.  When 'src_blksz' is non-zero,
 *	the data has a block-cyclic layout consisting of at least
 *	('elem_count'+'src_offset') elements with a block size of
 *	'src_blksz' elements per block.
 *	When GASNET_COLL_SINGLE is included in the 'flags' argument,
 *	the same value must be passed by all callers, and is used as the
 *	starting address of the array on all nodes (when 'src_blksz'
 *	is non-zero) or exactly one node (when 'src_blksz' is zero).
 *	When GASNET_COLL_LOCAL is included in the 'flags' argument,
 *	the value passed by each caller is independent and provides only
 *	the address of the array on the given image.
 * srclist: Source address(es)
 *	This argument replaces 'src' for use in the multiple-address
 *	interfaces.  When GASNET_COLL_SINGLE is included in the
 *	'flags' argument, this argument is an array of NImages
 *	addresses, which must be identical across all callers.  The ith
 *	address is used as the address of the ith image, where the
 *	correspondence between images and GASNet nodes is the one
 *	given by the gasnet_coll_init() call.  In the LOCAL case this
 *	argument may be passed independent values by each caller and on
 *	node i, is an array of images[i] local addresses, where
 *	images[] is the argument passed to gasnet_coll_init().
 * src_blksz: Source blocksize
 *	This argument gives the blocksize of the data layout for the
 *	array.  When equal to zero, 'src_blksz' denotes indefinite
 *	layout and 'src_offset' gives the index of the corresponding
 *	node or image.  Otherwise, this is the blocksize, in units of
 *	elements ('elem_size' bytes), of a block-cyclic layout.  The
 *	value of this argument must be equal across all callers or the
 *	behavior is undefined.
 * src_offset: Source offset
 *	This argument gives the offset to the first data element,
 *	relative to the base of the distributed array defined by the
 *	'src' or 'srclist' and 'src_blksz' arguments.  When
 *	'src_blksz' is zero the offset is in units of images, and
 *	gives the index of the image holding the data.  For the
 *	single-address interfaces images are synonymous with nodes,
 *	while for the multiple-address interfaces the node/image
 *	correspondence is that given by the gasnet_coll_init() call.
 *	When 'src_blksz' is non-zero the offset is in units of data
 *	elements ('elem_size' bytes) and follows the ordering of the
 *	block-cyclic layout.  The value of this argument must be equal
 *	across all callers or the behavior is undefined.
 *      Except where otherwise noted, if any of the source areas overlap any of
 *      the destination areas, the behavior is undefined.
 *      If the arguments to a multiple-address interface specify data
 *      movement involving two blocks from images coexisting on a 
 *      single node such that the blocks actually overlap in memory,
 *      the behavior is undefined (even if both are source blocks).
 * elem_size: Element size
 *	This argument gives the size, in bytes, of the data elements
 *	to be reduced, and must be equal across all callers or the
 *	behavior is undefined.
 * elem_count: Element count
 *	This argument gives the number of elements to be reduced, and
 *	must be equal across all callers or the behavior is undefined.
 * func, func_arg: Reduction function and argument
 *	These arguments define the client-provided function which will
 *	perform the reduction or prefix reduction and its one client-
 *	provided argument.  The 'func' argument is an integer index
 *	into the fn_tbl table passed to gasnet_coll_init().
 *	Both arguments must have uniform values across all callers or
 *	the behavior is undefined.  Passing of pointers in 'func_arg'
 *	is unsafe both because a pointer may be larger than an int,
 *	and because the single-valued constraint may not be
 *	satisfiable for pointers on some platforms.
 * flags: Flags argument
 *	The value of this argument must be equal across all callers or
 *	the behavior is undefined.  This argument gives a bitwise OR
 *	of flags which determine how the operation will be performed
 *	The folowwing flags are identical to those defined above for
 *	the data movement collectives:
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_{IN,OUT}_{NO,MY,ALL}SYNC
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_{SINGLE,LOCAL}
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_AGGREGATE
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_{DST,SRC}_IN_SEGMENT
 *	Additionally, every scan operation must include exactly one of
 *	GASNET_COLL_INCLUSIVE_SCAN or GASNET_COLL_EXCLUSIVE_SCAN:
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_INCLUSIVE_SCAN indicates that element i of the
 *	  result is the generalized sum over input elements 0 though i.
 *	+ GASNET_COLL_EXCLUSIVE_SCAN indicates that element i of the
 *	  result is the generalized sum over input elements 0 though i-1,
 *	  leaving element 0 of the output undefined.
 *	There is no default for the scan type.

//===========================================================================
END OF CURRENT PROPOSAL
START OF IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
//===========================================================================
* Thoughts on progress of implementation:

While not part of the GASNet spec for users, it is important that we
have a good design for how the reference implementation will interact
with the individual conduits.  In particular I see at least three ways
in which a conduit would wish to make progress on collectives:

1) Simple polling, for instance from gasnet_AMPoll().  This would be
   what we include in template-conduit as well as pure-polling
   implementations such as mpi-conduit.
2) Blocked thread.  A conduit may wish to create an extra thread just
   for the purpose of making progress on collectives.  For this reason
   it would be nice to have something like a condition variable on
   which such a thread could block until there was something to do.
3) Interrupts.  A conduit such as LAPI may be able to switch to a
   different operating mode in which the application is interrupted
   when network traffic arrives.  This would make it more responsive
   to the network for the purpose of advancing a collective operation
   but the added overhead is not desirable for normal operation.  So,
   one might wish to enter interrupt mode when one or more
   collectives are "live" and return to polled mode when none are
   live.

There is similarity between #2 and #3 that argues for a general
approach that they can each plug into.  In fact, #1 can be implemented
over the same generalization as a part of the template-conduit.

The general solution is to have hooks (provided by the conduit) which
are called at each entry to a collective initiation function and when
the collective is completed (probably in the "kick" function called by
gasnete_poll()).

/* Routine to make progress on collectives (if any): */
extern void gasnete_poll(void);

/* Conduit-specific hooks for counting live collectives: */
extern void gasnete_collective_entry_hook(void);
extern void gasnete_collective_leave_hook(void);


Here are versions of all three designs (not guaranteed to compile). I
would put these all into the template-conduit:

1) Simple polling:


Implement the following in gasnet_extended_fwd.h:

extern gasneti_atomic_t gasnetc_collective_count;

GASNETI_INLINE(gasnete_collective_entry_hook)
void gasnete_collective_entry_hook(void)
{
  gasneti_atomic_increment(&gasnetc_collective_count);
}

GASNETI_INLINE(gasnete_collective_leave_hook)
void gasnete_collective_leave_hook(void)
{
  gasneti_atomic_decrement(&gasnetc_collective_count);
}

#define GASNETE_POLL_IF_NEEDED() \
  if_pf (gasneti_atomic_read(&gasnetc_collective_count) != 0) \
    { gasnete_poll(); }

In the core, one would then call GASNETE_POLL_IF_NEEDED() in
gasnetc_poll(), at least in template-conduit, and perhaps at other
places where it could be helpful (such as right after an AM handler is
run).


2) Blocking thread:

To do this we just need to add a little to the case above.  Note that
we are about to add condition variables to gasnet.  They should be a
natural wrapper around pthread condition variables, taking a hsl in
place of a pthread mutex.  Note also that a handler may NEVER wait on a
condition variable, only signal it.  Prototypes for gasneti_cond*
appear in the next section.

Implement the following in gasnet_extended_fwd.h:

extern gasneti_atomic_t gasnetc_collective_count;
extern gasnet_hsl_t gasnetc_collective_hsl;
extern gasneti_cond_t gasnetc_collective_cond;

GASNETI_INLINE(gasnete_collective_entry_hook)
void gasnete_collective_entry_hook(void)
{
  gasneti_atomic_increment(&gasnetc_collective_count);
  gasneti_assert(gasneti_atomic_read(&gasnetc_collective_count) >= 1);
  gasnet_hsl_lock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
  gasneti_cond_signal(&gasnetc_collective_cond);
  gasnet_hsl_unlock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
}

GASNETI_INLINE(gasnete_collective_leave_hook)
void gasnete_collective_leave_hook(void)
{
  gasneti_atomic_decrement(&gasnetc_collective_count);
}

In the core, the thread would use something such as:

void gasnetc_collective_poll_thread(void)
{
  while (!EXITING()) {
    /* Note the "outer" test to reduce lock traffic.
     * In a race this can only cause extra calls to gasnete_poll().
     * Such extra calls are safe, but missing a wakeup is not.
     */
    if (gasneti_atomic_read(&gasnetc_collective_count) == 0) {
      while (!EXITING() && gasneti_atomic_read(&gasnetc_collective_count) == 0) {
         gasnet_hsl_lock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
         gasneti_cond_wait(&gasnetc_collective_cond, &gasnetc_collective_hsl);
         gasnet_hsl_unlock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
      }
    }

    if_pt (!EXITING()) {
      gasnete_poll();
    }

    // TODO: need a throttling mechanism here so that this thread
    // doesn't starve the working threads (which it may be waiting on) 
    // for CPU and lock resources
  }

  gasnetc_exit(0);
}


3) Interrupt mode

Implement the following in gasnet_extended_fwd.h:

extern unsigned gasnetc_collective_count;
extern gasnet_hsl_t gasnetc_collective_hsl;

GASNETI_INLINE(gasnete_collective_entry_hook)
void gasnete_collective_entry_hook(void)
{
  gasnet_hsl_lock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
  gasnetc_collective_count++;
  if (gasnetc_collective_count == 1) {
    ENTER_INTERRUPT_MODE();
  }
  gasnet_hsl_unlock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
}

GASNETI_INLINE(gasnete_collective_leave_hook)
void gasnete_collective_leave_hook(void)
{
  gasnet_hsl_lock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
  gasnetc_collective_count--;
  if (gasnetc_collective_count == 0) {
    LEAVE_INTERRUPT_MODE();
  }
  gasnet_hsl_unlock(&gasnetc_collective_hsl);
}




It might be tempting to merge the common ideas in #2 and #3 in to an
"edge triggered" pair of hooks, one called on the 0->1 transition and
the other on the 1->0 transition.  However, this would not work very
cleanly with the condition variable unless the hsl used to trigger the
hooks was exposed for use in the waiting thread.  I dislike that as an
unclear interface, and the code duplicated between #2 and #3 is too
small to justify such a design.


Regardless of implementation, it is important that any thread that may
have initiated RDMA or subordinate collectives continue to call
gasnete_poll()/gasnete_coll_poll() to ensure the corresponding handles
are synced to allow progress (and prevent a resource leak).  To ensure
this, once a conduit-interal thread calls gasnete_poll(), it must continue
to do so until there are no collectives in-flight (since we don't presently
expose any "this thread has unsynced handles inside the collectives").
This is true not only of any thread dedicated to collectives, but of ALL
conduit-internal threads.  If a conduit-internal thread normally would
go to sleep (such as the vapi AM recv thread that blocks until an AM
arrival), then it must either
 1) Never enter the collective progress engine
or
 2) Enter the collective progress engine, but disable the blocking/sleeping
    behavior until there are no collectives in-flight.


//===========================================================================
* Notes on (non-)commutative (prefix) reduction operators.

Imagine X # Y # Z, where # is some operator implemented by f(.,.).

Let C={True,False} denote commutativity

C = False:
	Freedom to change grouping, but not order.
	Only legal options are f(f(X,Y), Z) and f(X, f(Y,Z))
C = True:
	Freedom to change grouping and order, allowing 12 options:
	    f(f(X,Y),Z)	      f(X,f(Y,Z))
	    f(f(X,Z),Y)	      f(X,f(Z,Y))
	    f(f(Y,X),Z)	      f(Y,f(X,Z))
	    f(f(Y,Z),X)	      f(Y,f(Z,X))
	    f(f(Z,X),Y)	      f(Z,f(X,Y))
	    f(f(Z,Y),X)	      f(Z,f(Y,X))

For operators which are non-commutative (i.e. matrix multiply on
non-square matrices) we can perform partial reductions over the blocks
in parallel, but cannot reduce multiple blocks per row on a given node
w/o communication.  The communication that IS required for a reduction
can be done in O(log(P)) stages which moves n_elems/blk_sz/P elements
per node in each stage.  [This is not the only way to do it.]

For operators which are commutative we can reduce the multiple blocks
on a node to a single scalar before starting communication.  We can
perform the full reduction in O(log(P)) stages requiring only a single
scalar communicated per node per stage.

Note that for pure-blocked layout there is no difference in
implementation between commutative and non-commutative operators.  For
the case of pure-cyclic the difference is the most extreme.


//===========================================================================
* Notes on algorithms 

Broadcast:
----------

In [Karp93] we learn how to construct an optimal schedule for
broadcast.  The tree can be built knowing only the ratio
A=ELL/max(O_s,g).  Using a heap data structure one can determine the
tree structure for a P-node broadcast in O(log(P!)) time.  Note that
O(P) < O(log(P!)) < O(P*log(P)), so the cost to construct the schedule
grows superlinearly.  However, it doesn't require any communication
(deterministic algorithm allows all nodes to compute the same schedule
independently).

For the case of A>>1 the communication is latency dominant and the
optimal broadcast is the naive one in which the root sends data to
each other node in sequence.  For the case of A near 1, the optimal
tree shape is a Binomial tree [Kielmann99].  Here are, for P=8, model
results for the "EEL" of a broadcast with four different tree shapes
on three different networks.  Note that these are in us and are
directly comparable between networks.  However, they are just model
results, not real timings.  The "Flat" tree is the one-level tree of
the naive broadcast.  The percentages are relative to the optimal.

		gm		vapi		mpi-conduit
Optimal		21		24		334
Binomial	21 		30 (+28%)	570 (+171%)
Binary		26 (+24%)	30 (+28%)	570 (+171%)
Flat		43 (+105%)	31 (+32%)	334

The binary tree and the "flat" tree are the easiest two to implement.
With just these two choices, we can get within 30% of the optimal on
the two fast networks, and the flat tree is the optimal for the slow
network.  I don't have any bound on just how bad we could do with
these two, or any heuristic for choosing between them.  However, I
expect to implement them as the first two versions.

Later I hope to implement the construction of the optimal trees.  I
can see doing it two ways:
1) At init time for some fixed A, ignoring the data size.
2) At runtime, using some size-dependent (and conduit-specific) model
   for A and caching the results so it can be reused when the same
   size is repeated.  Note that the data to cache would just be
   P*sizeof(gasnet_node_t) bytes.


Scatter:
--------

The LogGP paper [Alexandrov95] describes an algorithm for constructing
the optimal scatter, analogous the the broadcast scahedule of [Karp93].
This being log_G_P, takes proper consideration of the varying size of
the messages when a tree is used to forward data.


Gather:
-------

The Gather is exactly the same as scatter with all the data moving in
the opposite direction.  Therefore whatever I decide for Scatter will
also be used to implement Gather.


Exchange:
---------

The final data placement is equivalent to doing P scatters, one with
each node as the root.  In a simple LogP model where we can only send
a single data item per communication operation, the optimal [Karp93]
is to perform P naive scatters in lock-step, but choosing the order of
each node's sends so each node receives exactly once per step.  The
simplest such ordering is for node p to send to ((p+1) mod P), ((p+2)
mod P),... ((p+P-1) mod P).


Gather_All:
-----------

The final data placement is equivalent to doing P broadcasts.  In the
LogP model with single-item sends the optimal [Karp93] is the same as
described above for Exchange, but with the same data item instead of
distinct ones.

If we allow a node to send more than a single data item per send, then
we can improve on the methods above.  If we divide the communication
into ceil(lg(P)) rounds (where lg denoted base-2 log) then each round
can forward an exponentially increasing amount of data (1 item in
round 0, 2 items in round 1, 2^i items in round i).  At the end of the
final round each node has received 2^i items.  With the correct
pairings for these sends, we can ensure that all P <= 2^i items are
received at each node (and with a little care we can even avoid
sending the "surplus" 2^i-P that exists when P is not a power of two).
The ordering for this is that in round i (starting from 0) node p will
send to node ((p+2^i) mod P).  As it happens, this is exactly the same
communication pattern used in the Dissemination barrier
[Mellor-Crummey91; sec 3.3], but now we are also moving real data.

For small P the Exchange-like algorithm is faster, even if we assume
the timings are constant as the payload size grows in each round.  As
the ratio A (=ELL/max(O_s,g)) increases the crossover point moves
toward larger P.  The dominant term for the Exchange-like algorithm is
O(P*max(O_s,g)), due to the gap between the P sends from each node.
The dominant term for the Dissemination-like algorithm is
O(lg(P)*ELL), due to the need to wait for data to arrive (before
resending it) at each of the lg(P) rounds.  Both algorithms move the
exact same number of data bytes in and out of each node.  The
Dissemination-like algorithms tries to reduce the number of sends
needed to actually move the data, but must pay a cost proportional to
ELL to wait for the needed data to arrive.


Permute:
--------

Other than implementing the UPC synchronization, there is no obvious
mechanism by which GASNet can do any better than the use of Puts.


Reduce:
-------

As noted in [Karp93], the optimal communication pattern for reduction
in the LogP model is the same tree as for Broadcast.  The order and
direction of the comms are reversed and the data elements moving are
partial "sums" from each subtree.  There is no big concern over
unequal contributions here, since each node must contribute exactly 1
or 0 "sums" to the total reduction.

The implementation of non-commutative operators will take a little
extra work, since in a cyclic or block-cyclic layout we can't reduce
all the elements on a given node to a single scalar before we begin
communication.

Getting non-commutative operators right will also slightly restrict
the trees we could legally use.  However, the optimal trees are still
optimal under any permutation of the node labels other than the root.
Thus, we can always construct trees such that each subtree contains
only consecutive contributions to the reduction.  We'd probably
construct our tree this way regardless of commutativity of our
operator.


PrefixReduce:
-------------

The interface which is developing for this addresses how to express
the unequal contribution from the nodes.  I've whiteboarded some ideas
and found that the communication pattern used by the dissemination
barrier (and discussed as a possible all-gather-all implementation) is
also an efficient algorithm for prefix reduction, regardless of
commutativity of the operator.

Step 1: Setup dst array

We first copy the src to the dst.  In the case that the first element
of the src and dst array are not identically aligned, this will be a
collective data movement not expressed by any of the existing
interfaces.  Where the src and dst are aligned, this step is entirely
free of communication.

Step 2: Partial sums

Once the dst array is initialized with a copy of the src array, each
node performs a reduction (NOT a prefix reduction) over each "row" of
its block-cyclic contribution.  This results in ceil(n_elem/blk_sz/P)
partial reductions per node, with some nodes potentially having
exactly one fewer if things aren't aligned perfectly.  This step is
entirely free of communication.

Step 3: Disseminating the partial reductions

Using a communication pattern identical to that of the dissemination
barrier, the partial reductions can be passed around in such a way
that every node can accumulate the partial reductions it will need to
complete the prefix reduction.  At each of log(P) phases each node
will send to exactly one peer and receive from exactly one peer, thus
there are no hot spots.  Each of these pairwise communications
includes the partial reductions for each "row", and thus sends
n_elem/blk_sz/P elements (give or take 1).  In each phase the partial
reductions received are accumulated with the per-row reductions
already received before sending the combined result in the next phase.

This step is hard to convey w/o a whiteboard.  So, you'll have to take
my word that when done in this way we naturally accumulate the partial
reductions (w/o needing to assume the operator is commutative) that
would be needed to perform either a all-reduce-all or a prefix-reduce.
We can actually reduce the size of some of the messages since we don't
need any partial reductions coming "from the right".  However, in the
block-cyclic case it is only the partial reductions of the first and
last "row" that might potentially be eliminated from some messages.

Step 4: Prefix reduction

At this point each node has the partial reductions it needs, one per
"row".  For instance, if a given node in a block-cyclic layout holds
elements 2 and 3 in one "row" and elements 6 and 7 in another, then
step 3 has generated SUM(a[0]..a[1]) and SUM(a[2]..a[5]).  Using these
two values one can finally perform the prefix reduction.

Notes on MPI Collectives:

The MPI collectives interface design and implementations are an important
precedent for our work. Here's a few notes from a brief reading of the spec
that are relevant to our future work:

* MPI's inter-communicators are primarily intended to support client-server
  paradigms and dynamic job layouts that are outside the scope of GASNet. We can
  safely ignore all the inter-communicator goop.

* MPI's collectives are all blocking and all have semantics analogous to 
  IN_MYSYNC/OUT_MYSYNC.

* MPI collectives allows varying contributions from each node and do not require
  single-valued arguments. We should consider generalizing UPC/GASNet
  collectives similarly.

* MPI reduce and scan operations allow the user to compute multiple, independent 
  reductions at once using a single call and recieve all the results (the data
  from each node is reduced element-wise with the corresponding elements on each
  node and the result returned similarly). This trivialy allows coalescing of
  messages, and is the only way to get communication overlap of logically
  independent MPI collectives with respect to a given node. GASNet provides
  non-blocking collectives, loose synchronization modes and aggregation to expose
  communication overlap (and is more fully general because it allows
  aggregation/overlap with reductions of other types, collectives of other
  varieties, collective operations on other teams, and other arbitrary
  computation and communication). However, the current UPC interface does not
  expose non-blocking operations, which means that from a user level the MPI
  reduction interface is currently more expressive. One notable advantage to the
  MPI-style reduction interface is that multiple independent reduction results
  can be computed using a single call to a user-provided callback - our current
  callback interface does not allow this optimization.

* MPI provides the interesting reduction operators MINLOC and MAXLOC, which
  compute a minimum/maximum value and the index of the node holding that value
  (the operator is carefully defined to break ties in such a way that the
  operator is both commutative and associative). It may be nice for UPC to
  provide these as built-in operators (of course, a user could write these
  for themselves, but they may not realize that's what they want or that 
  if can be done using a commutative/associative operator).

* MPI provides a reduce-to-all operation that is currently lacking in
  UPC/GASNet, and can presumably be implemented more efficiently in some cases
  than a reduce followed by a broadcast.

* MPI has a very powerful and expressive interface for efficiently creating and
  manipulating teams (groups/communicators). We should definitely use it as a
  model when defining our team constructors and ensure we can provide an equal
  level of generality. However, we should probably leave out the silly attribute
  caching in MPI communicators - it adds no useful functionality (all of the
  provided rationales for it can trivially be addressed by adding a level of
  indirection), so it just needlessly adds complexity. The MPI topology
  description library is similarly extraneous.

* MPI-2 adds a few new features to the MPI 1.2 collectives library which may be relevant for us:

  - "in-place" versions of most of the collectives - an MPI_IN_PLACE flag
    generally specifies the source arguments are ignored and the destination
    arguments specify the source and destination for an in-place collective.
    In-place versions are likely to add some copying costs, but may be helpful for
    applications doing collectives over very large data sets (avoid doubling the
    necessary heap space just for communication, especially if the collective
    library can manage internal temporary space to get similar performance with
    much less memory overhead). There may also be some benefits in cache/firehose
    locality using an in-place operation that has a smaller memory footprint. 
    We could add a similar flag if we convince UPC this is a useful feature. 

  - "Exclusive-scan" prefix reduction - a prefix reduction where image 0 gets
    an undefined result and image i gets the result of 0 op 1 op .. op i-1.
    Exclusive scan is more general than inclusive scan and can implement inclusive
    scan with one final local evaluation of the reduction operator (the converse 
    is not true for important, non-invertable operators like MIN/MAX). We should 
    consider providing both (and implement inclusive using the exclusive one)
