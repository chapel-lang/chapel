GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet-EX 2018.9.0 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from

  https://gasnet.lbl.gov/

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.


Chapel modifications to GASNet
==============================

The modifications that we have made to the official GASNet release are
as follows:

* Pulled in an upstream fix for mpi-spawner -N support for Open MPI 3.x
   - https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/gasnet-ex/commits/bdd352a5c
* Pulled in an upstream fix for heterogenous jobs under aries
   - https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/gasnet-ex/commits/5f5199a2

Upgrading GASNet versions
=========================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/ contains the
un-tarballed GASNet package contents.  Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/:

1. un-tarball the new package version into the directory it specifies,
   for example GASNet-2018.9.0
2. git rm -r gasnet-src
3. mv GASNet-2018.9.0 gasnet-src
4. git add --force gasnet-src
   ('--force' is needed so that the 'git add' ignores our .gitignore)
5. commit
6. update the new sources by re-applying any needed patches (see above)
   and commit
7. PR, merge, etc.
