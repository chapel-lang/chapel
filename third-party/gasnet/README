GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel for convenience and
uses a snapshot of GASNet obtained from UC Berkeley at:
http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu.

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as the cause
is most likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet
library itself.

The modifications that we have made to the official GASNet 1.24.0
release are as follows:

* Added support for launching an xterm window running gdb in the udp
  active messages layer if the environment variable CHPL_COMM_USE_GDB
  is set.  Our modification is not particularly elegant, but it should
  be innocuous for non-Chapel developers, and has been exceedingly
  useful for the Chapel development team.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile        : a Makefile to help build GASNet for Chapel's use
  README          : this file
  GASNet-1.*.*/   : the current GASNet release
  install/        : as GASNet is built it will be installed here:
    $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM-$CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER/
      seg-$CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT/
        nodbg/
