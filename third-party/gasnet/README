GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel for convenience and
uses a snapshot of GASNet obtained from UC Berkeley at:
http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu.

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as the cause
is most likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet
library itself.

The modifications that we have made to the official GASNet 1.22.0
release are as follows:

* Added support for launching an xterm window running gdb in the udp
  active messages layer if the environment variable CHPL_COMM_USE_GDB
  is set.  Our modification is not particularly elegant, but it should
  be innocuous for non-Chapel developers, and has been exceedingly
  useful for the Chapel development team.

* Added support for tilera targets.

* Applied a patch sent by the GASNet team, to make programs using the
  Cray-specific Aries substrate link libhugetlbfs in whole-archive mode.
  This fixed some initialization-time problems that were seen in that
  configuration.  The patch changed the configure.in file and then we
  needed to re-run the Bootstrap step.  The commit contained the result
  of all of that.

* Applied two patches sent by the GASNet team, which address a problem
  with mapping and unmapping memory for the gemini and aries conduit
  when pshm is disabled (which is what we do by default on Crays and
  most other configurations).

The structure of this directory is as follows:
