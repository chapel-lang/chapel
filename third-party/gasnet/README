GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet 1.30.0 is being released with Chapel for
convenience and was obtained from

  https://gasnet.lbl.gov/

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at https://chapel-lang.org/bugs.html.


Chapel modifications to GASNet
==============================

The modifications that we have made to the official GASNet release are
as follows:

* Added preliminary support for 64-bit ARM.  This adds the new file
  third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/other/contrib/cross-configure-aarch64-linux
  which is the only ARM change beneath gasnet-src in the tree.

* Pulled in an upstream fix for a gemini/aries multi-domain initialization bug:
   - https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/gasnet/commits/ed2fd98eb
* Pulled in an upstream performance improvement for InfiniBand:
   - https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/gasnet/commits/5cb86a7e0
* Pulled in an upstream fix for slow uncoordinated shutdowns with segment smp:
   - https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/gasnet/commits/a636c641d

Upgrading GASNet versions
=========================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/ contains the
un-tarballed GASNet package contents.  Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/:

1. un-tarball the new package version into the directory it specifies,
   for example GASNet-1.30.0
2. git rm -r gasnet-src
3. mv GASNet-1.30.0 gasnet-src
4. git add --force gasnet-src
   ('--force' is needed so that the 'git add' ignores our .gitignore)
5. commit
6. update the new sources by re-applying any needed patches (see above)
   and commit
7. PR, merge, etc.
