GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel for convenience and
uses a snapshot of GASNet obtained from UC Berkeley at:
http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu.

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at http://chapel.cray.com/bugs.html as the cause
is most likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet
library itself.

Chapel modifications to GASNet
==============================

The modifications that we have made to the official GASNet release are
as follows:

* Added support for launching an xterm window running a debugger in the
  udp active messages layer if either of the environment variables
  CHPL_COMM_USE_GDB or CHPL_COMM_USE_LLDB is set.  Our modification is
  not particularly elegant, but it should be innocuous for non-Chapel
  developers, and has been exceedingly useful for the Chapel development
  team.

* Added preliminary support for 64-bit ARM.  This adds the new file
  third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/other/contrib/cross-configure-aarch64-linux
  which is the only ARM change beneath gasnet-src in the tree.

Upgrading GASNet versions
=========================

The directory $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/gasnet-src/ contains the
un-tarballed GASNet package contents.  Version updates should be done as
follows, assuming the CWD is $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/:

1. un-tarball the new package version into the directory it specifies,
   for example GASNet-1.28.0
2. git rm -r gasnet-src
3. mv GASNet-1.28.0 gasnet-src
4. git add --force gasnet-src
   ('--force' is needed so that the 'git add' ignores our .gitignore)
5. commit
6. update the new sources by re-applying any needed patches (see above)
   and commit
7. PR, merge, etc.
