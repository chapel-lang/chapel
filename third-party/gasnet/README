GASNet for Chapel release
=========================

This copy of GASNet is being released with Chapel for convenience and
uses a snapshot of GASNet obtained from UC Berkeley at:
http://gasnet.cs.berkeley.edu.

Any Chapel issues that seem to be related to GASNet should be directed
to the Chapel team at chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net, as the cause
is most likely due to Chapel's use of GASNet and not the GASNet
library itself.

The modifications that we have made to the official GASNet release are
as follows:

* Added support for launching an xterm window running a debugger in the
  udp active messages layer if either of the environment variables
  CHPL_COMM_USE_GDB or CHPL_COMM_USE_LLDB is set.  Our modification is
  not particularly elegant, but it should be innocuous for non-Chapel
  developers, and has been exceedingly useful for the Chapel development
  team.

The structure of this directory is as follows:

./
  Makefile        : a Makefile to help build GASNet for Chapel's use
  README          : this file
  gasnet-src/     : the current GASNet release
  install/        : as GASNet is built it will be installed here:
    $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM-$CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER-$CHPL_TARGET_ARCH/
      seg-$CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT/
        nodbg/
