User Information:
-----------------

The most important difference between GASNet and shmem lies in the semantics
for synchronization.  While GASNet strives for general and flexible
synchronization, shmem provides only two synchronization primitives -- a fence
for ordering puts and a quiet for guaranteeing remote completion.  Moreover,
these primitives are exclusively temporal in that they cannot be associated
with any specific operation, and only applies to put (write) operations (get
operations block). GASNet attempts to expose finer-grained synchronization
control over individual memory operations, which on shmem only translates to
added overhead since there is no way one-to-one mapping between per-operation
GASNet synchronization and shmem put/get calls.

Since shmem targets are usually shared-memory machines that allow loads/stores
to be issued to global memory, the GASNet conduit is engineered to allow
non-blocking puts/gets to be issued with the least amount of instructions.

The conduit implementation differs from other conduits in that most of the
extended functionality is actually inlined through
gasnet_extended_help_extra.h.  The core AM functionality is fairly tuned and is
not inlined, as are the various split-phase barrier mechanisms.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

* GASNET_NETWORKDEPTH
  Can be set to a any power of 2, smaller or equal to 256 and constitutes the
  queue depth set aside for incoming GASNet core AM requests from all nodes
  that can be queued at a given node without blocking.

* GASNET_SHMEM_DEBUGALLOC
  Set to 1 to output shmem allocation debug information (such as which
  addresses are being mapped by each process for the GASNet segment).

* GASNET_BARRIER=SHMEM (default)
  Enables shmem-native implementation of GASNet barriers

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

* GASNETE_NBISYNC_ALWAYS_QUIET: See description above in 'GASNet implicit
  memory operations and synchronization (nbi)'

* GASNETE_GLOBAL_ADDRESS_CLIENT: If defined, the conduit makes no effort to
  translate global addresses and assumes that every address passed to GASNet is
  a global address that requires no further translation.  In other words,
  issuing a gasnet_put(0xaaaaa, 5) at node 5 translates into a store exactly at
  address 0xaaaa.  If undefined, the conduit uses whatever the system offers to
  translate local into global pointers.

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.

* Conduit only works with SGI and Cray X1 'flavors' of shmem.  These two
  implementations have native hardware access to global memory, a feature that
  was considered when designing the conduit.
  The SGI 'flavor' is know to work on an SGI Altix (Linux based), while
  only partial success was observed on an SGI Origin 2000 (IRIX based).

Future work:
------------

* Port the conduit to other shmem flavors, particularly those on cluster-based
  systems for which nothing other than MPI and shmem is available.
* Possibly complete the testing and debugging of support on IRIX.

Design Overview:
----------------

GASNet explicit memory operations (nb):

  put_nb, put_nb_bulk:
    returns GASNETE_SYNC_QUIET
    * Actual data transfer mechanism optimized per-target (X1, Altix, ...)
    * A subsequent call to individually sync a put operation calls shmem_quiet
      and returns GASNET_OK.
    * A subsequent call to sync an array of puts calls shmem_quiet only once
      and marks the remaining puts as invalid and returns GASNET_OK.

  memset_nb
    returns GASNETE_SYNC_NONE
    * Always issued as a blocking operation, for simplicity.  If these were
      non-blocking, the sync_nb calls that we would want as lightweight would
      have to poll on AM arrivals -- too expensive and complex for the
      seemingly useless non-blocking memset.  Always return SYNC_NONE since we
      complete the operation before returning.

  get_nb, get_nb_bulk:
    returns GASNETE_SYNC_DONE
    * Actual data transfer mechanism optimized per-target (X1, Altix, ...)
    * Since transfers on the typical shmem targets (X1, Altix) are through
      registers, the main processor cannot asynchronously fetch data and the
      processor will stall if it attempts to use any value obtained through the
      memory transfer.  These transfers are always blocking and therefore
      return SYNC_NONE since no subsequent synchronization is required.


GASNet explicit synchronization (nb):
  Try and Wait are the same -- try always commits the sync.

  wait_syncnb, try_syncb:
    returns GASNET_OK *always*
    * Implemented as inlined function (important for vectorization).
    * If handle is SYNC_QUIET, issue a shmem_quiet and return GASNET_OK
    * If handle is SYNC_NONE, simply return GASNET_OK

  wait_syncnb_all, try_syncnb_all, wait_syncnb_some, try_syncnb_some:
    returns GASNET_OK *always*
    * Implemented as function calls.
    * Mark all handles as invalid (done)
    * If at least one SYNC_QUIET was encountered, issue shmem_quiet.


GASNet implicit memory operations and synchronization (nbi):

  GASNETE_NBISYNC_ALWAYS_QUIET: When set to 1, no per-operation information is
    kept for each put/get operation and a subsequent sync_nbi always causes a
    shmem_quiet().  This has the disadvantage of issuing a quiet for nbi
    operations consisting of only gets but allows simpler code paths for
    issuing the nbi operations since no metadata is required -- the
    put_nbi/get_nbi is effectively only a store/load.

  All NBI synchronization is accumulated in 'gasnete_nbisync_cur'.  For
  regions, ending a region returns the current value of gasnete_nbisync_cur and
  gasnete_nbisync_cur is reset for subsequent regions or other NBI operations.

  put_nbi, put_nbi_bulk, get_nbi, get_nbi_bulk:
    * Actual data transfer mechanism optimized per-target (X1, Altix, ...)

  memset_nbi
    * Always issued as blocking operation (see memset_nb above).

  syncnbi_gets:
    returns GASNET_OK
    * No synchronization required, gets are always blocking

  syncnbi_puts:
    if GASNETE_NBISYNC_ALWAYS_QUIET, issues shmem_quiet and returns GASNET_OK
    else, issues shmem_quiet and returns GASNET_OK iff gasnete_nbi_sync_cur is
          set to SYNC_QUIET.
