// GASNet-EX API Description //
///////////////////////////////
//
// This is *not* a final normative document.
// This is "beta documentation" for a work-in-progress.
//
// This document assumes a reasonable degree of familiarity with the current
// (aka GASNet-1) specification: https://gasnet.lbl.gov/dist/docs/gasnet.pdf
//
// Except where otherwise noted, all definitions in this document
// are provided by gasnetex.h.

// Document Conventions
//
// This document includes the annotation [UNIMPLEMENTED] in several places
// where we feel we have a suitable design ready for consideration, but
// have yet to provide a complete and/or correct implementation.
//
// This document includes the annotation [EXPERIMENTAL] in several places
// where we feel we have a suitable design and an implementation which is
// sufficiently complete to be used.  However, based on feedback received
// from early use, the design may change in non-trivial ways (to the degree
// that client code may need to change).

//
// This takes the form YEAR.MONTH.PATCH in GASNet-EX releases,

//
// Relationship to GASNet-1 APIs:
//
// This release should continue to support nearly all GASNet-1 APIs,
// provided the client #includes <gasnet.h>, which implements the
// GASNet-1 APIs in terms of the new GASNet-EX interfaces.
//
// Most gasnet_ APIs have gex_ counterparts that are either interoperable,
// or which provide a superset of the most closely-related gasnet_ APIs.
//
// Where a gex_/GEX_ identifier is interoperable or synonymous with
// a gasnet_/GASNET_ identifier, that is noted below.
//

// Hybrid/transitional client support:
//
// Clients who are incrementally adopting GASNet-EX may have a period of time
// when they are using both GASNet-1 and GASNet-EX APIs in the same process. 
// Such clients should initialize GASNet using *either* the legacy 
// gasnet_init()/gasnet_attach() calls, or the new gex_Client_Init() call
// (described in a subsequent section).
//
// Note that gasnet_init()/gasnet_attach() may only be called once per process,
// and currently only one client per process can use GASNet-1 APIs.
//
// Hybrid/transitional clients who initialize using gex_Client_Init() should
// pass the following flag to that function to request the use of GASNet-1 services.
// 
#define GEX_FLAG_USES_GASNET1 ((gex_Flags_t)???)

// The following API allows jobs that initialize GASNet for legacy support to
// access the key GASNet-EX objects created explicitly by gex_Client_Init(), or
// implicitly by gasnet_init()/gasnet_attach().  The types and usage of these
// objects are described below.  Initialization for legacy support is either of
// the following:
// + Initialization using the legacy gasnet_init()/gasnet_attach() APIs
// + Initialization using gex_Client_Init() with GEX_FLAG_USES_GASNET1
//
// This call is defined in gasnet.h (not gasnetex.h).
//
// The arguments are all pointers to locations for outputs, each of which
// may be NULL if the caller does not need a particular value.
//
//     client_p: receives the gex_Client_t
//   endpoint_p: receives the gex_EP_t
//         tm_p: receives the gex_TM_t
//    segment_p: receives the gex_Segment_t, if any
//
extern void gasnet_QueryGexObjects(gex_Client_t      *client_p,

// Calls from restricted context
//
// The only GASNet functions which may be called within AM handler context,
// or while holding a GASNet handler-safe lock are as follows:
//
// gasnet_mynode(), gasnet_nodes(), gasnet_hsl_*(), gasnet_exit(), gasnet_AMReply*(), 
// gasnet_QueryGexObjects(), gex_System_QueryNbrhdInfo(), gex_System_QueryHostInfo(),
// gex_System_QueryMyPosition(), gex_System_QueryJob{Rank,Size}(), gex_HSL_*(),
// gex_*_{Set,Query}CData(), gex_{Client,Segment,EP,TM,AD}_Query*()
// gex_AM_Max*(), gex_AM_LUB*(), gex_Token_Max*(), gex_Token_Info(),
// 
// The following are conditionally permitted in handler context, the condition being the 
// caller must be within an AMRequest handler and not holding a handler-safe lock:
//
// gex_AM_Reply*() gex_AM_{Prepare,Commit}Reply*(), gex_AM_SrcDesc*()
//
// All other functions are prohibited to be called from a thread within the 
// dynamic context of an AM handler, or while holding a handler-safe lock.
// This prohibition notably prohibits all communication initiation (aside from Reply 
// injection from a Request handler), explicit polling and test/wait operations on handles/events.

//
// Glossary:
// The following terms will be used with specific meanings in this document.
//

// "Collective Call"
//
// Several APIs in this specification are described as being "collective
// calls".  All collective calls are collective with respect to a specific
// ordered set of participants, which is usually specified by an argument
// naming a team (discussed later in detail).  The designation of a call
// as collective over a given team means:
//  + For every given team that exists in an execution of the program, all
//    collective calls made over that team are initiated "in the same order"
//    by all team members -- otherwise behavior is undefined.
//  + Here "in the same order" means that for every member of a given team,
//    the calls over that team and their arguments are "compatible" across all
//    members at every point in their respective sequence of collective calls
//    over the team.
//  + The definition of "compatible" as used here may vary slightly as
//    defined individually for each call.  However, in the absence of per-call
//    documentation to the contrary the following rules apply:
//    - The function called must be the same, or from a related group of calls
//      explicitly documented as mutually compatible.
//    - Any arguments documented as "single-valued" must be identical across
//      all callers.
//    - Any additional argument compatibility constraints documented for a
//      given call must be satisfied.
//
// In addition to the requirement on compatibility of collective calls over
// any given team, all collective calls over *distinct* teams must be ordered
// such that no deadlock would occur if all such calls were replaced by
// blocking barriers.  A formal specification of this constraint will appear
// in a future revision of this document.

// "Single-valued"
//
// This term is used to designate an argument to a collective call as one that
// must have the same value on all callers participating in the collective.
//
// In the case of 'flags' arguments, this term may be applied in a qualified
// form as "partially single-valued" when the constraint applies only to some
// bits (with freedom to differ in the remaining bits).

//
// Basic types:
//

// Rank

// The type gex_Rank_t is used for a position within, or size of, an ordered
// set (such as a team).
// Guaranteed to be an unsigned integer type
// This type is interoperable with gasnet_node_t
typedef [some unsigned integer type] gex_Rank_t;

// Pre-defined constant used to indicate "not a rank".
// Use may have different semantics in various contexts.
// Guaranteed to be larger than any valid rank.
// However, a specific value is NOT defined by specification.
// In particular, might NOT be equal to GASNET_MAXNODES
#define GEX_RANK_INVALID ((gex_Rank_t)???)

// "Job rank":
// In a non-resilient build this will be the same as the rank in the team
// constructed by gex_Client_Init() and will be identical across clients.
// This is semantically equivalent to gasnet_mynode().
//
// Semantics in a resilient build will be defined in a later release.
gex_Rank_t gex_System_QueryJobRank(void);

// "Job size":
// In a non-resilient build this will be the same as the size in the team
// constructed by gex_Client_Init() and will be identical across clients.
// This is semantically equivalent to gasnet_nodes().
//
// Semantics in a resilient build will be defined in a later release.
gex_Rank_t gex_System_QueryJobSize(void);


// Events

// An "Event" is an opaque scalar type, representing a handle
// to an asynchronous event that will be generated by a pending operation.
// Events are a generalization of GASNet-1 handles, in that 
// a single non-blocking operation may expose several events
// associated with its progress (eg local and remote completion).
// Initiation of a event-based (NB-suffix) non-blocking operation will
// usually generate one root event (representing the completion
// of the entire operation), and zero or more leaf events 
// (representing completion of intermediate steps).
// Root events must eventually be synchronized by passing them
// to a Wait or successful Test function, which recycles all the
// events (root and leaf) associated with the operation in question.
// Leaf events may optionally be synchronized before that point.
// This type is interoperable with gasnet_handle_t
// - Sync operation: test/wait with one/all/some flavors
//   + Success consumes the event
typedef ... gex_Event_t;

// Pre-defined output values of type gex_Event_t
// - GEX_EVENT_INVALID
//   + result for already-completed operation
//   + synonymous with GASNET_INVALID_HANDLE
//   + guaranteed to be zero
// - GEX_EVENT_NO_OP
//   + result for a failed communication attempt (eg immediate-mode
//     injection that encountered backpressure)
//   + guaranteed to be non-zero
//   + Erroneous to pass this value to test/wait operations
#define GEX_EVENT_INVALID      ((gex_Event_t)0)
#define GEX_EVENT_NO_OP        ((gex_Event_t)???)

// Pre-defined input values of type gex_Event_t*
// These are passed to communication injection operations
// in place of a pointer to an actual gex_Event_t for certain leaf
// events, to forgo an independent leaf event and instead request
// specific predefined behavior:
// - GEX_EVENT_NOW
//   + Pass to require completion of the leaf event before returning
//     from the initiation call
// - GEX_EVENT_DEFER
//   + Pass to allow deferring completion of the leaf event to as late 
//     as completion of the root event
// - GEX_EVENT_GROUP
//   + Pass to NBI initiation calls to allow client to use NBI-based
//     calls to detect event completion (or to use an explicit event
//     returned/generated by gex_NBI_EndAccessRegion()).

// this case calls with return type 'gex_Event_t' return
// GEX_EVENT_NO_OP while those with return type 'int' will
// return non-zero.
//
// Additionally, calls with this flag are not required to make any
// progress toward recovery of the "necessary resources".  Therefore,
// clients should not assume that repeated calls with this flag will
// eventually succeed.  In the presence of multiple threads, it is
// even possible that calls with this flag may never succeed due to
// racing for resources.
//

//
// This mutually-exclusive pair of flags *may* override GASNet-EX's

// SEGMENT DISPOSITION
//
// The following family of flags assert the segment disposition of 
// address ranges provided to communication initiation operations.
//
// The segment disposition flags come in two varieties:
//
// SELF - describes the segment disposition of addresses associated
//        with local memory and the initiating endpoint (ie the EP 
//        which is usually implicitly named by a gex_TM_t argument).
//        Eg in a Put operation this variety describes source locations,
//        and in a Get this variety describes destination locations.
//
// PEER - describes the segment disposition of addresses associated
//        with (potentially) remote memory and the peer endpoint(s)
//        (the EPs usually explicitly named by gex_Rank_t arguments)
//        Eg in a Put operation this variety describes destination locations,
//        and in a Get this variety describes source locations.
//
// The following flags are mutually exclusive within each variety -
// a given operation may specify at most one SELF flag and one PEER flag.
// Unless otherwise noted, the default behavior for each variety in the
// absence of an explicitly provided flag corresponds to:
//    GEX_FLAG_SELF_SEG_UNKNOWN, GEX_FLAG_PEER_SEG_BOUND
// which is backwards-compatible with GASNet-1 segment behavior.
// NOTE: the flags below are currently [UNIMPLEMENTED], and consequently
// these defaults are also the only supported settings for all APIs.
//
// Each explicit flag has a distinct bit pattern.
// Unless otherwise noted, the caller is responsible for ensuring the
// assertions expressed by these flags to a given call remain true for 
// the entire period of time that the described address sequences are "active" 
// with respect to the operation requested by the call. The definition of
// "active" varies based on call type, but generally extends from entry to
// the call accepting the assertions until completion is signalled for 
// all described address ranges.
//
// {SELF,PEER}_SEG_UNKNOWN
//
// These flag bits indicate that the corresponding address range(s)
// are not known by the caller to reside within current GASNet-EX segments.
// Example 1: the address ranges are known to lie partially or entirely
//   outside any segments in the process hosting the respective endpoint(s).
// Example 2: the caller lacks information about the segment disposition
//   of the address ranges, and passes this flag to reflect a lack of
//   such assertions and request maximally permissive behavior
//   (potentially incurring a performance cost).

// created by any client in the process hosting the respective endpoint.

// + When passed either of the GEX_FLAG_AM_PREPARE_LEAST_{CLIENT,ALLOC} flags,
//   these queries return the maximum legal 'least_payload' argument value for
//   the corresponding gex_AM_Prepare{Request,Reply}{Medium,Long}() call
//   (collectively known as "negotiated-payload AM" prepare calls).
//
// These are max payload queries for specific peer, numargs, lc_opt and flags,
// except that (other_rank == GEX_RANK_INVALID) does not ask about a specific
// rank, it the yields min-of-maxes over all team members.
//
// 1. The result of each query function is guaranteed to be symmetric - ie if
//    two team members execute a given query on each other's ranks, with all
//    other input arguments being equal, the queries are guaranteed to return
//    the same value.  Note this does NOT imply any relationship between the
//    results of different query functions (eg MaxRequestMedium versus
//    MaxReplyMedium).
// 2. If other_rank == GEX_RANK_INVALID, then all team members are guaranteed
//    to get the same result given the same values of the other input
//    arguments.  Otherwise, other_rank specifies the other team member
//    involved in the operation being queried (where the rank making the query
//    is implicitly involved).  Note that due to the symmetry described above,
//    'other_rank' can (and should) always name the other party in the
//    communication, regardless of whether that rank or the caller is to be
//    the sender or the receiver.
// 3. 'numargs' must be between 0 and gex_AM_MaxArgs(), inclusive.  It is
//    guaranteed that increasing 'numargs' will produce monotonically non-
//    increasing results when all other parameters are held fixed.
// 4. 'lc_opt' indicates the payload local completion option to be used for
//    the AM injection or prepare call in question.  The predefined constants
//    GEX_EVENT_NOW and GEX_EVENT_GROUP should be used directly, while a
//    pointer to any variable of type gex_Event_t (or a NULL pointer) may be
//    used interchangeably to indicate that the injection or prepare call
//    passes any such value (without requiring that the same pointer value be
//    passed).
// 5. 'flags' indicates the flags that will be provided to the corresponding
//    AM injection or prepare function (and should not to be confused with the
//    handler registration flags).  The result of the query is only guaranteed
//    to be correct for an injection of prepare call with exactly the same
//    'flags', excepting only that the GEX_FLAG_AM_PREPARE_LEAST_* flags may
//    be omitted from a prepare call.
//
// The result of all four query functions is guaranteed to be at least 512 (bytes).
//
// The result is guaranteed to be stable - ie for the same set of input arguments,
// it will always return the same value.
//
// Aside from the explicit guarantees above, the result may otherwise vary
// with the input arguments in unspecified ways, and thus only defines the
// documented limit for an call with corresponding values of (tm, other_rank,
// lc_opt, flags and numargs).  For example, limits may vary between different
// pairs of ranks on the same team, or even between the same pair of processes
// linked via different team or client.

//   have selectable behavior with respect to local completion (which
//   means that the source buffer may safely by written, free()ed, etc).
//
//   Short AMs have no payload and therefore have no 'lc_opt' argument.
//
//   The Medium and Long Requests accept the pre-defined constant values
//   GEX_EVENT_NOW and GEX_EVENT_GROUP, and pointers to variables of type
//   'gex_Event_t' (note that GEX_EVENT_DEFER is prohibited).  
//   The NOW constant requires that the Request call not
//   return until after local completion.  The GROUP constant allows the
//   Request call to return without delaying for local completion and adds
//   the AM operation to the set of operations for which
//   gex_NBI_{Test,Wait}() call may check local completion when passed
//   GEX_EC_AM.  Use of a pointer to a variable of type 'gex_Event_t'
//   allows the call to return without delay, and requires the client to later
//   check local completion of this root event using gex_Event_{Test,Wait}*().
//
//   The 'lc_opt' argument to Medium and Long Reply calls behave as for the
//   Requests with the exception that GEX_EVENT_GROUP is *not* permitted.
//   It is also important to note that it is not legal to "test", or
//   "wait" on a 'gex_Event_t' in AM handler context.
//   [TBD: we *could* allow handlers to make bounded calls to "test", which
//   does not Poll, if we wanted to.]

// Negotiated-payload AM APIs
//

// The fixed-payload APIs for Active Message Mediums and Longs (brought
// forward from GASNet-1) allow sending any payload up to defined maximum
// lengths.  However, this comes with the potential costs of extra in-memory
// copies of the payload and/or conservative maximum lengths.  Use of the
// negotiated-payload APIs can overcome these limitations to yield performance
// improvements in two important cases.  First, when the client can begin the
// negotiation before the payload is assembled (for instance concatenation of
// a client-provided header and application-provided data) payload negotiation
// can ensure that the GASNet conduit will not need to make an additional
// in-memory copy to prepend its own header, or to send from pre-registered
// memory.  Second, when the client has a need for fragmentation and
// reassembly (due to a payload exceeding the maximums) use of negotiated
// payload may permit a smaller number of fragments by taking advantage of
// transient conditions (for instance in GASNet's buffer management) that
// allow sending AMs with a larger payload than can be guaranteed in general.
//
// The basis of negotiated-payload AMs is a split-phase interface: "Prepare"
// and "Commit".  The first phase is a Prepare function to which the client
// passes an optional source buffer address, the minimum and maximum lengths
// it is willing to send, and many (but not all) of the other parameters
// normally passed when injecting an Active Message.  In this phase, GASNet
// determines how much of the payload can be sent.
//
// The return from the Prepare call provides the client with an address and a
// length.  The length is in the range defined by the minimum and maximum
// lengths.  When the client_buf argument is non-NULL, the address provided by
// the return will be exactly that value.  Otherwise the address will be a
// GASNet-allocated buffer of the indicated length, suitably aligned to hold any
// data type.
//
// It is important to note that passing NULL for the client_buf argument to a
// Prepare call requires GASNet to allocate buffer space of size no smaller
// than least_payload.  Use of gex_AM_Max{Request,Reply}{Medium,Long}() with
// the GEX_FLAG_AM_PREPARE_LEAST_ALLOC flag is intended to enforce limits on
// the space GASNet is required to allocate.  However, the current release does
// not yet impose limits tighter than the corresponding fixed-payload queries.
// Therefore, some extra care should be taken to keep such allocation demands
// reasonable.
//
// Between the Prepare and the Commit calls the client is responsible for
// assembling its payload (or the prefix of the given length) at the selected
// address (potentially a no-op).  The client may send a length shorter than
// the value returned from the Prepare, for instance rounding down to some
// natural boundary.  The client may also defer until the Prepare-Commit
// interval its selection of the AM handler and arguments, which might depend
// on the address and length returned by the Prepare call (though the number
// of args must be fixed at Prepare).  In the case of a Long, the client may
// also defer selecting the destination address.  These various parameters are
// passed to the Commit function which performs the actual AM injection.
//
// It is important to note that in the interval between a Prepare and Commit,
// the client is bound by the same restrictions as in an Active Message Reply
// handler (ie all communication calls are prohibited).  Prepare/commit pairs
// do not nest.  Additionally, the Prepare returns a thread-specific object
// that must be consumed (exactly once) by a Commit in the same thread. Calls
// to Prepare are permitted in the same places as the corresponding
// fixed-payload AM injection call.
//
// Currently the semantics of the least_payload==0 case are unspecified.
// We advise avoiding that case until a later release has resolved this.

//
// NOTE 2a: The 'lc_opt' argument for local completion (NBI case)
//
//   Implicit-event non-blocking Puts have an 'lc_opt' argument which
//   controls the behavior with respect to local completion.  The value can
//   be the pre-defined constants GEX_EVENT_NOW, GEX_EVENT_DEFER, or
//   GEX_EVENT_GROUP.  The NOW constant requires that the call not
//   return until the operation is locally complete.  The DEFER constant
//   permits the call to return without delaying for local completion,
//   which may occur as late as in the call which syncs (retires) the
//   operation (could be an explicit-event call if using an NBI access
//   region).  The GROUP constant allows the call to return without
//   delaying for local completion and adds the operation to the set for
//   which gex_NBI_{Test,Wait}() call may check local completion when

// A "host" is an abstract boundary in the system hierarchy that is guaranteed
// to be a superset of the neighborhood, but the exact definition may be
// system-specific.  Generally it encompasses processing resources associated
// with a single physical address space and OS kernel image.  When using
// GASNet-Tools from the same release, it is guaranteed that the definition
// for "host" is consistent with the following:
//   gasnett_cpu_count(), gasnett_getPhysMemSz()
// However, there is no guarantee of correspondence to gasnett_gethostname().

//
// Remote Atomic Operations
// APIs in this section are provided by gasnet_ratomic.h
//

//
// Atomic Domains
//
// An "Atomic Domain" is an opaque scalar type.
//
// Just as all point-to-point RMA calls take a gex_TM_t argument, calls to
// initiate Remote Atomic operations take a gex_AD_t, where "AD" is short for
// "Atomic Domain".
//
// + Creation of an AD associates it with a specific gex_TM_t.
//
//   This association defines the memory locations which can be accessed using
//   the AD.  Only memory within the address space of a process hosting an
//   endpoint that is a member of this team may be accessed by atomic
//   operations which pass a given AD.
//
//   Currently, there is an additional constraint that target locations must
//   lie within the bound segments of the team's endpoints.
//
// + Creation of an AD associates with it one data type and a set of operations.
//
//   This permits selection of the best possible implementation which can
//   provide correct results for the given set of operations on the given data
//   type.  This is important because the best possible implementation of a
//   operation "X" may not be compatible with operation "Y".  So, this best
//   "X" can only be used when it is known that "Y" will not be used.  This
//   issue arises because a NIC may offload "X" (but not "Y") and use of a
//   CPU-based implementation of "Y" would not be coherent with the NIC
//   performing a concurrent "X" operation.
//
// + Use of an AD is conceptually tied to specific data and time.
//
//   Correct operation of gex_AD_Op*() APIs is only assured if the client code
//   can ensure that there are no other accesses to the same target locations
//   concurrent with the operations on a given AD.
//
//   The prohibition against concurrent access applies to all access by CPUs,
//   GPUs and any other hardware that references memory; and to all GASNet-EX
//   operations other than the atomic accesses defined in this section.  The
//   write by a fetching remote atomic operation to an output location on the
//   initiator is NOT an atomic access for the purposes of this prohibition.
//
//   Prohibited accesses by CPUs and GPUs include not only load/store, but
//   also any atomic operations provided by languages such as C11 and C++11,
//   by compiler intrinsics, operating system facilities, etc.
//
//   This prohibition also extends to concurrent access via multiple ADs, even
//   if created with identical arguments.  However, this specification does
//   not prohibit concurrent access to distinct (non overlapping) data using
//   distinct ADs.
//
//   GASNet-EX does not provide any mechanisms to detect violations of the
//   prohibitions described above.
//
// + Atomic Access Phases [INCOMPLETE / OPEN ISSUE]
//
//   It is the intent of this specification to permit access to the same data
//   using remote atomics and other (non-atomic) mechanisms, and to the same
//   data using multiple atomics domains.  However, such different accesses
//   must be NON-concurrent.  This separation is into what we will call
//   "atomic access phases":
//     During a given atomic access phase, any given byte in the memory of any
//     GASNet process shall NOT be accessed by more than ONE of:
//      (1) gex_AD_Op*() calls that reference that byte as part of the target
//          object.
//      (2) any means except for (1).
//     Furthermore, during a given atomic access phase, all gex_AD_Op*() calls
//     accessing a given target byte shall use the same AD object.
//
//   Note that the byte-granularity of this definition has consequences for
//   the use of union types and of type-punning, either of which may result in
//   a given byte being considered part of multiple C objects.
//
//   The means for a transition between atomic access phases has not yet been
//   fully specified.  We do NOT expect that the resolution to this open issue
//   will invalidate any interface defined in this current specification.
//   However, when implementations of remote atomics are introduced with
//   properties such as caching, it may become necessary for clients using
//   remote atomics to take additional steps to transition between atomic
//   access phases.
//
//   FOR *THIS* RELEASE we believe it is sufficient to separate atomic access
//   phases by a barrier synchronization.  However, it is necessary to ensure
//   that any GASNet-EX accesses which may conflict have been completed
//   (synced) prior to the barrier.  This includes completing all remote atomic
//   operations before a transition to non-atomic access or accesses by a
//   different atomic domain; and completing all other GASNet data-movement
//   operations (RMA, Collective, etc.) before a transition to atomic access.
//
// + Memory Ordering/Fencing/Consistency
//
//   By default calls to the gex_AD_Op*() APIs are not guaranteed to be ordered
//   with respect to other memory accesses.  However, one can request Acquire
//   or Release fencing through the use of 'flags' as described in more detail
//   with the description of gex_AD_Op*().  The definitions given below for
//   Acquire and Release are intended to be compatible with the same concepts
//   in the C11 and C++ language specifications for atomic operations.

//
// The 'flags' argument provides additional control over the created domain.
//  + GEX_FLAG_AD_FAVOR_{MY_RANK,MY_NBRHD,REMOTE}

//    absence of these flags will never impact correctness.

//
// Remote Atomic Operations
//
// Remote atomic operations are point-to-point communication calls that
// perform read-modify-write and accessor operations on typed data (the
// "target location") in the address space of a process hosting an endpoint
// that is a member of the team passed to gex_AD_Create().
//
// These operations are guaranteed to be atomic with respect to all other
// accesses to the same target location made using the same AD, from any rank.
// When using a thread-safe endpoint this includes atomicity of concurrent
// access by multiple threads within a rank.  No other atomicity guarantees
// are provided.  [Currently all endpoints are "thread-safe" when using a
// GASNET_PAR build, and no endpoints are thread-safe otherwise.]
//
// Despite "Remote" in the name, it is explicitly permitted to apply these
// operations to the caller's own memory (and a high-quality implementation
// will optimize this case when possible).
//
// Additional semantics are described following the "Argument synopsis".
//
// Return value:
//
// Atomic operations are available with explicit-event (NB) or implicit-event
// (NBI) completion, with different return types:
//
//  + The gex_AD_OpNB_*() APIs return a gex_Event_t.
//
//    If (and only if) the GEX_FLAG_IMMEDIATE flag is passed to remote atomic
//    initiation, these calls are *permitted* to return GEX_EVENT_NO_OP to
//    indicate that no operation was initiated.  Otherwise, the return value
//    is an event to be used in calls to gex_NBI_{Test,Wait}() to check for
//    completion.  These calls may return GEX_EVENT_INVALID if the operation
//    was completed synchronously.
//
//  + The gex_AD_OpNBI_*() APIs return an integer.
//
//    If (and only if) the GEX_FLAG_IMMEDIATE flag is passed to remote atomic
//    initiation, these calls are *permitted* to return non-zero to indicate
//    that no operation was initiated.  Otherwise, the return value is zero
//    and a gex_NBI_{Test,Wait}() call must be used to check completion.  For
//    the opcodes GEX_OP_SET and GEX_OP_GET, one should use GEX_EC_PUT and
//    GEX_EC_GET, respectively, to check completion.  All other opcodes
//    correspond to an event category of GEX_EC_RMW.
//
// Data types and prototypes:
//   The APIs for remote atomic initiation are typed.  Therefore, descriptions
//   and prototypes below use "[DATATYPE]" to denote the tokens corresponding
//   to the "???" in each supported GEX_DT_???, and "[TYPE]" to denote the
//   corresponding C type.  There is an instance of each function (NB and NBI)
//   for each supported data type.
//   See the "Data types for atomics and reductions" section for which data
//   types are supported for remote atomics, and their corresponding C types.
//
// "Fetching":
//   Text below uses "fetching" to denote operations that write to an output
//   location ('*result_p') at the initiator (and "non-fetching" for all
//   others).
//   See the "Operation codes (opcodes) for atomics and reductions" section
//   for which opcodes are fetching vs non-fetching.
//
// Endpoints:
//   Let 'tm' denote the corresponding argument passed to gex_AD_Create().
//   The endpoint associated with 'tm' is known as the "initiating endpoint".
//   The endpoint named by (tm, tgt_rank) is known as the "target endpoint".
//
// Argument synopsis:
//   gex_AD_t       ad
//     + The Atomic Domain for this operation.
//   [TYPE] *       result_p
//     + Address (or offset) of the output location for fetching operations.
//       Ignored for non-fetching operations.
//   gex_Rank_t     tgt_rank
//     + Rank of the target location
//   void *         tgt_addr
//     + Address (or offset) of the target location
//   gex_OP_t       opcode
//     + Indicates the operation to perform atomically.
//       Operations are described with the definition of gex_OP_t.
//   [TYPE]         operand1
//     + First operand, if any.
//       Ignored if the given opcode takes no operands.
//   [TYPE]         operand2
//     + Second operand, if any.
//       Ignored if the given opcode takes fewer than two operands.
//   gex_Flags_t    flags
//     + Per-operation flags
//       A bitwise OR of zero or more of the GEX_FLAG_* constants.
//
// Semantics of gex_AD_Op*():
//
// + Successful synchronization of a fetching remote atomic operation means
//   that the local output value (at *result_p) is ready to be examined, and
//   will contain a value that was held at the target location at some time in
//   the interval between the call to the initiation function and the
//   successful completion of the synchronization.  This value will be the one
//   present at the start of the atomic operation and denoted as 'op0' in the
//   definition of the applicable opcode.
//   [THIS PARAGRAPH IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A FORMAL MODEL.
//    HOWEVER, ONE IS FORTHCOMING.]
//
// + Successful synchronization of any remote atomic operation means the
//   operation has been performed atomically (including any constituent Read
//   and Write access to the target location) and any remote atomic issued
//   subsequently by any thread on any rank with the same AD and target
//   location will observe the Write, if any (assuming no intervening updates).
//   [THIS PARAGRAPH IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A FORMAL MODEL.
//    HOWEVER, ONE IS FORTHCOMING.]
//
// + Atomicity guarantees apply only to "target locations".  They do not apply
//   to the output of a fetching operation.  Therefore, clients must check for
//   operation completion before the output value of a fetching operation can
//   safely be read (analogous to the destination of an gex_RMA_Get*()).
//   Additionally, a given 'result_p' location must not be used as the target
//   location of remote atomic operations in the same atomic access phase.
//   (see "Atomic Access Phases").
//
// + If two target objects accessed by gex_AD_Op*() overlap (partially or
//   completely) those accesses are subject to the restrictions documented in
//   "Atomic Access Phases" above.  In particular, such accesses are
//   permitted during the same atomic access phase *only* if the accessed
//   bytes exactly coincide and the calls use the same AD object.
//
// + Currently, the target location must be contained entirely within the
//   bound segment of the target endpoint (though this may eventually be
//   relaxed).
//
// + The data type associated with 'ad' and that of the gex_AD_Op*() call must
//   be equal.
//
// + The 'result_p' argument to fetching operations must be a valid pointer to
//   an object of the given type [TYPE] on the initiator.  (See also the
//   description of the [UNIMPLEMENTED] GEX_FLAG_SELF_SEG_OFFSET flag, below.)
//
// + The 'result_p' argument to non-fetching operations is ignored.
//
// + The 'tgt_rank' argument names the target endpoint.  By default, this
//   argument must be a valid rank relative to the team associated with the AD
//   at its creation.  However, in the presence of GEX_FLAG_RANK_IS_JOBRANK,
//   this argument instead names the target endpoint by a valid rank in the
//   primordial team, created by gex_Client_Init().  In this latter case the
//   named endpoint must be a member of the team associated with the AD at its
//   creation.
//
// + The 'tgt_addr' argument names the target location, which must be properly
//   aligned for its data type [TYPE] and (for any operation except
//   GEX_OP_SET) must contain an object with compatible effective type,
//   including a qualified version of [TYPE], and (for integer types only)
//   including signed or unsigned variants.  (See also the description of the
//   [UNIMPLEMENTED] GEX_FLAG_PEER_SEG_OFFSET flag, below.)
//
// + The 'opcode' argument gives the operation to be performed atomically.
//   See the "Operation codes (opcodes) for atomics and reductions" section
//   for definitions of each operation.
//
// + The 'opcode' must be a single GEX_OP_* value, not a bitwise OR of two or
//   more GEX_OP_* values.
//
// + The 'opcode' must be a member of the set of opcodes passed to
//   gex_AD_Create().
//
// + Operations on floating-point data types are not guaranteed to obey all
//   rules in the IEEE 754 standard even when the C float and double types
//   otherwise do conform.  Deviations from IEEE 754 include (at least):
//     - Operations on signalling NaNs have undefined behavior.
//     - (F)CAS *may* be performed as if on integers of the same width.
//       This could result in non-conforming behavior with quiet NaNs
//       or negative zero.
//     - MIN, MAX, FMIN and FMAX *may* be performed as if on "sign
//       and magnitude representation integers" of the same width.
//       This could result in non-conforming behavior with quiet NaNs.
//       (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985, and especially
//       the section Comparing_floating-point_numbers)
//   [THIS PARAGRAPH MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF NON-IEEE BEHAVIORS]
//
//  + If the given opcode requires one or more operands, the 'operand1'
//    argument provides the first ('op1' in the gex_OP_t documentation).
//    Otherwise, 'operand1' is ignored.
//
//  + If the given opcode requires two operands, the 'operand2' argument
//    provides the second ('op2' in the gex_OP_t documentation).
//    Otherwise, 'operand2' is ignored.
//
//  + The 'flags' argument must either be zero, or a bitwise OR of one or more
//    of the following flags.
//     - GEX_FLAG_IMMEDIATE: the call is permitted (but not required) to
//       return a distinguishing value without initiating any communication if
//       the conduit could determine that it would need to block temporarily
//       to obtain the necessary resources.  The NBI calls return a non-zero
//       value (only) in this "no op" case, while the NB calls will return
//       GEX_EVENT_NO_OP.
//     - At most one flag from the following mutually-exclusive group:
//       - GEX_FLAG_AD_MY_RANK: asserts that the initiating endpoint and target
//         endpoint are the same endpoint.  This may allow the implementation to
//         perform the operation more efficiently.
//         The precise definition of the assertion is:
//           (tgt_rank == gex_TM_QueryRank(gex_AD_QueryTM(ad))).
//       - GEX_FLAG_AD_MY_NBRHD: asserts that the target EP belongs to
//         a process within the "Neighborhood" (defined earlier in this
//         document) of the calling process.  This may allow the
//         implementation to perform the operation more efficiently.
//     - GEX_FLAG_AD_REL: this atomic operation shall perform a "release".
//       Within the thread that initiates this operation, memory accesses by
//       the processor, issued before the initiation call, shall not be
//       reordered after that call.  Additionally, this includes accesses to
//       memory by any GASNet operations synchronized by that thread before
//       initiation.  However, there is no ordering with respect to other
//       GASNet operations.
//     - GEX_FLAG_AD_ACQ: this atomic operation shall perform an "acquire".
//       Within the thread that synchronizes this operation, memory accesses by
//       the processor, issued after the synchronization call, shall not be
//       reordered before that call.  Additionally, this includes accesses to
//       memory by any GASNet operations initiated by that thread after
//       synchronization.  However, there is no ordering with respect to other
//       GASNet operations.
//     - GEX_FLAG_RANK_IS_JOBRANK: this flag indicates that the 'tgt_rank'
//       argument is a jobrank (rank in the primordial team created by
//       gex_Client_Init()), rather than the rank in the team associated with
//       the AD at its creation.
//     - [UNIMPLEMENTED] GEX_FLAG_SELF_SEG_OFFSET: 'result_p' is to be
//       interpreted as an offset relative to the bound segment of the
//       initiating endpoint (instead of as a virtual address).
//       Ignored for non-fetching operations.
//     - [UNIMPLEMENTED] GEX_FLAG_PEER_SEG_OFFSET: 'tgt_addr' is to be
//       interpreted as an offset relative to the bound segment of the target
//       endpoint (instead of as a virtual address).

// End of section describing APIs provided by gasnet_ratomic.h
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Vector/Indexed/Strided (VIS)
//
// APIs in this section are provided by gasnet_vis.h

// This API is an updated and expanded version of the VIS prototype offered
// in GASNet-1, which is documented here: https://gasnet.lbl.gov/pubs/upc_memcpy_gasnet-2.0.pdf

// The following semantics apply to all VIS functions:

// For NB variants, return type for all functions in this section is gex_Event_t.
// For NBI/Blocking variants, the return type is int which is non-zero *only* in the
// "no op" case (IMMEDIATE flag), exactly analogous to the gex_RMA_{Put,Get}*() functions.
//
// By default, local completion of all client-owned input buffers (ie payload
// buffers and metadata arrays) passed to non-blocking initiation functions
// can occur as late as operation completion, and thus must remain valid until
// that time (as in GASNet-1).
// As an exception, the metadata arrays passed to Strided variants ({src,dst}strides[] and count[])
// are guaranteed to be consumed synchronously before return from initiation.
// gex_VIS_*Put{NB,NBI} optionally expose local completion of data payload buffers -
// this functionality must be requested using the GEX_FLAG_ENABLE_LEAF_LC flag (see below).
//
// A future revision may expose other intermediate completion events [UNIMPLEMENTED]
//
// The 'flags' argument must either be zero, or a bitwise OR of one or more
// of the following flags:
// - GEX_FLAG_IMMEDIATE: the call is permitted (but not required) to return a
//   distinguishing value without initiating any communication if the conduit
//   could determine that it would need to block temporarily to obtain the
//   necessary resources.  The Blocking and NBI calls return a non-zero value
//   (only) in this "no op" case, while the NB calls will return GEX_EVENT_NO_OP.
// - GEX_FLAG_ENABLE_LEAF_LC: (gex_VIS_*Put{NB,NBI} only) This flag requests
//   asynchronous local completion indication for the local data payload buffers 
//   comprising the source region(s) of the VIS Put operation. Without this flag,
//   local completion behaves as GEX_EVENT_DEFER, i.e. folded into operation completion.
//   When this flag is passed to gex_VIS_*PutNBI, asynchronous local completion indication 
//   behaves as specified in sec:`Extended API` for lc_opt=GEX_EVENT_GROUP.
//   When this flag is passed to gex_VIS_*PutNB, asynchronous local completion indication 
//   behaves as specified in sec:`Extended API` for lc_opt=&(gex_Event_t variable).
//   In the latter case, the client should retrieve the gex_Event_t corresponding to
//   local completion by passing the root gex_Event_t returned by the Put initiation
//   call to gex_Event_QueryLeaf(), for example:
//     gex_Event_t VISput_RC = gex_VIS_VectorPutNB(..., GEX_FLAG_ENABLE_LEAF_LC);
//     gex_Event_t VISput_LC = gex_Event_QueryLeaf(VISput_RC, GEX_EC_LC);
//   The second call is only valid when GEX_FLAG_ENABLE_LEAF_LC was passed to the _VIS_*PutNB()
//   call, and otherwise has undefined behavior.

// Strided Puts and Gets
//

// These operate similarly to the GASNet-1 prototype gasnet_{put,get}s_* API,
// but the metadata format is changing slightly in EX.  Notable changes:
// + The stride arrays change type from (const size_t[]) to (const ptrdiff_t[])
// + The 'count[0]' datum moves to a new parameter 'elemsz', and the subsequent
//   elements 'count[1..stridelevels]' "slide down", meaning 'count' now references
//   an array with 'stridelevels' entries (down from 'stridelevels+1').
// Note that 'elemsz' need not match the "native" element size of the underlying
// datastructure, it just needs to indicate a size of contiguous data chunks
// (eg, it could be the length of an entire row of doubles stored contiguously).
// These interface changes enable the Strided interface to support more generalized
// strided data movements (specifically, transpose and reflection).
//
// Degenerate cases:
//
// * If elemsz == 0:
//   the operation is a no-op and all other arguments are ignored
// * If stridelevels == 0:
//   the operation is a contiguous copy of elemsz bytes, and the 
//   srcstrides, dststrides, count arguments are all ignored
// * If any entry in count[0..stridelevels-1] == 0:
//   the operation is a no-op and tm, rank, srcaddr, dstaddr are ignored
//   ({src,dst}strides must still reference valid arrays)
//
// Restrictions:
//
// * If any destination location overlaps a source location or another destination
//   location, the result is undefined. Source locations are permitted to overlap
//   with each other.
//
// * Metadata array inputs must remain valid and unchanged until after synchronization
//   of operation completion (this restriction may eventually be loosened)

// VIS Put Peer Completion [EXPERIMENTAL]
//

// The following call "arms" a peer completion callback that will 
// signal completion of the next VIS operation initiated by the current thread 
// to the (possibly remote) peer endpoint. When the selected VIS data movement
// operation is complete with respect to the peer, an Active Message 
// (with some restrictions defined below) is delivered to the peer endpoint.
// Currently this feature is only supported for VIS Put operations (not Gets).
//
// Argument synopsis:
//   gex_AM_Index_t  handler
//     + The AM handler index to invoke at the peer endpoint.
//   const void *    source_addr 
//   size_t          nbytes
//     + The local source address and length of an optional client-provided payload
//       to be delivered in the AM notification.
//   gex_Flags_t    flags
//     + Unused in the current release, should be set to zero.
//
// + This call "arms" a peer completion handler and binds it to the next VIS operation
//   successfully initiated by the current thread. Only the next such operation is affected, after
//   which the peer completion binding for this thread is automatically "disarmed".

//
// Collectives (Coll) [EXPERIMENTAL]
//
// With the exception of gex_Coll_BarrierNB(), APIs in this section are provided
// by gasnet_coll.h
//

// This API is an updated and expanded version of the collectives prototype
// offered in GASNet-1, and previously documented in docs/collective_notes.txt.
// As these APIs are fully specified and implemented, the corresponding
// portions of the GASNet-1 collectives prototype will be removed from
// gasnet_coll.h and replaced with GEX variants.  The GASNet-1 collectives API
// signatures will not be supported in future releases.

// The following semantics apply to all Coll functions:

// For NB variants, return type for all functions in this section is gex_Event_t.
// There are no NBI or Blocking variants at this time.

// All functions in this section are "Collective Calls" as defined in the
// Glossary.

// Multiple collective operations from this section may be active concurrently,
// over multiple teams or over a single team.  There is no longer an exception
// regarding gex_Coll_BarrierNB(), as was the case in an earlier release.

// GASNet-EX collectives and the GASNet-1 barrier must not operate concurrently.
// Specifically, the gasnet_barrier*() family of calls may not operate
// concurrently with any gex_Coll_*() operation (including barriers) over the
// primordial team (created by gex_Client_Init(flags=GEX_FLAG_USES_GASNET1) or
// obtained from a call to gasnet_QueryGexObjects()).
//   - Collective operations over the primordial team issued prior to a
//     GASNet-1 barrier over the same team must be complete/synchronized prior
//     to initiating the barrier.
//   - No collective call may be initiated over the primordial team between the
//     initiation and completion/synchronization of any GASNet-1 barrier over
//     the same team.
// [This restriction may be relaxed in a future release]
//
// Uses of the GASNet-1 barrier APIs which do not violate the restriction above
// are permitted in the same program as GASNet-EX collectives.

// In contrast to the UPC-influenced design of the GASNet-1 collectives, the
// GASNet-EX collectives do not support "NOSYNC" or "ALLSYNC" flags (they
// behave as if IN_MYSYNC|OUT_MYSYNC), nor single-valued address information.
// [A future release may re-introduce single-valued addressing for symmetric
// heaps via offset-based addressing]
// In this respect, the intuition one may hold from MPI-3 non-blocking
// collectives is largely applicable.

// By default, local completion of all client-owned input buffers ('src'
// arguments) passed to the collective initiation functions can occur as late
// as operation completion, and thus these buffers must remain valid until that time.
//
// A future revision may expose intermediate completion events [UNIMPLEMENTED]

// Upon operation completion (synchronization of the gex_Event_t returned at
// initiation) the following will hold:
// + Any input buffer ('src' argument) will be locally complete (analogous
//   to the source of a gex_RMA_PutNB() with GEX_EVENT_DEFER).
// + Any output buffer ('dst' argument) is ready to be examined by the thread
//   performing the sync of the gex_Event_t (analogous to the destination of
//   a gex_RMA_GetNB()).
// + Unless otherwise noted in the description of a given operation, there are
//   no guarantees regarding the state on other ranks participating in the
//   collective operation nor their associated input and output buffers.

// Unless noted explicitly, no API in this section, other than a Barrier, is
// required to synchronize the calling ranks.  However, the implementation is
// *permitted* to do so in any call in this section.

// NOTE: All of the (void *) types for source and destination buffers in these
// APIs will eventually be gex_Addr_t [UNIMPLEMENTED]

//
// Collectives Part I.  Barrier
//

// Split-phase barrier over a Team
//
// This is a collective call over the team named by the 'tm' argument that
// initiates a split-phase (non-blocking) barrier over the callers.
//
// + The return value is a root event which can be successfully synchronized
//   (return from gex_Event_Wait*() or zero return from gex_Event_Test*())
//   only after all members of the team have issued a corresponding call.
// + This call is non-blocking (may return before other team members have
//   issued a corresponding call).
// + Calls to gex_Coll_BarrierNB() are not "compatible" with calls to
//   gasnet_barrier() or gasnet_barrier_notify() for the purpose of
//   determining collective calling order.
// + The barrier operation provides the following memory ordering behaviors:
//   - Initiating a barrier operation shall perform a "release".
//     Within the thread that initiates the operation, memory accesses by the
//     processor, issued before the initiation call, shall not be reordered
//     after that call.  Additionally, this includes accesses to memory by any
//     GASNet operations synchronized by that thread before initiation.
//     However, there is no ordering with respect to other GASNet operations.
//   - Synchronizing a barrier operation shall perform an "acquire".
//     Within the thread that synchronizes the operation, memory accesses by
//     the processor, issued after the synchronization call, shall not be
//     reordered before that call.  Additionally, this includes accesses to
//     memory by any GASNet operations initiated by that thread after
//     synchronization.  However, there is no ordering with respect to other
//     GASNet operations.
//
// tm:      The call is collective over the associated team.
// flags:   Flags are reserved for future use and must currently be zero
//

//
// Collectives Part II.  Data Movement
//
// The following argument descriptions are applicable to all collective data
// movement APIs in this section using arguments with these names.
//
// root:
//      The rank within 'tm' of one distinguished endpoint.  More information
//      on the distinguishing role of the root is provided with the detailed
//      description of each such collective operation.
//      This is always a single-valued parameter.
// src:
//      The local address of the caller's input buffer, if any.
//      This is not a single-valued parameter.
// dst:
//      The local address of the caller's output buffer, if any.
//      This is not a single-valued parameter.
// nbytes:
//      The length in bytes of one element of data.
//      This is a single-valued parameter.
// flags:
//      A bitwise OR of zero or more of permitted GEX_FLAG_* constants.
//      Currently no flags are defined for data-movement collective
//      operations, and the value zero should be passed.
//      However, a future release will support the "segment disposition"
//      flags [UNIMPLEMENTED].
//      Individual flags bits may or may not be single-valued, as will
//      be documented with each supported flag.

// Broadcast
//
// This operation copies 'nbytes' bytes of data starting at 'src' on rank
// 'root' of 'tm', to 'dst' on every rank within the 'tm'.
//
// The value of 'src' is ignored on all ranks other than 'root'.
//
// On the 'root' rank, the data is copied from 'src' to 'dst' except in the
// case these pointers are equal.  However, any other overlap between 'src'
// and 'dst' buffers on the root rank yields undefined behavior.

gex_Event_t gex_Coll_BroadcastNB(
            gex_TM_t        tm,            // The team
            gex_Rank_t      root,          // Root rank (single-valued)

            gex_Flags_t     flags);        // Flags (partially single-valued)

//
// Collectives Part III.  Computational
//

// User-Defined Reduction Operations
//
// GASNet provides a set of useful built-in reduction operations.  These
// should be favored whenever possible in performance-critical reductions,
// because using a built-in operator is generally a prerequisite to leveraging
// hardware-offload support for reductions which is available in some network
// hardware.  However for situations where none of the provided built-in
// operations fit client requirements, GASNet also allows clients to provide
// code for their own reduction operation.
//
// Reduction operations which do not correspond to a built-in opcode
// (GEX_OP_*) constant are supported by passing GEX_OP_USER or GEX_OP_USER_NC
// as the 'op' when initiating a reduction.
// + GEX_OP_USER: denotes a user-defined operation that is both
//   associative and commutative.
// + GEX_OP_USER_NC: denotes a user-defined operation that is
//   associative but NOT commutative. [UNIMPLEMENTED]
//
// The implementation will invoke the user-provided function an unspecified
// number of times to perform the user's operation on a pair of vectors of
// operands.
//
// The user-defined reduction operation is passed to the initiation call using
// a function pointer with type gex_Coll_ReduceFn_t:
    typedef void (*gex_Coll_ReduceFn_t)(
            const void * arg1,         // "Left" operands
            void *       arg2_and_out, // "Right" operands and result
            size_t       count,        // Operand count
            const void * cdata);       // Client-data
// These arguments are defined as follows, with additional semantics below:
//   arg1:
//     This is a pointer to memory containing 'count' consecutive operands.
//     These may be caller-provided input values or intermediate results.
//     In the case of a non-commutative operation, these are the operands on
//     the "left-hand side" of the nominal operator.
//     The reduction operation is not permitted to write to this memory.
//   arg2_and_out:
//     This is a pointer to memory containing 'count' consecutive operands.
//     These may be caller-provided input values or intermediate results.
//     In the case of a non-commutative operation, these are the operands on
//     the "right-hand side" of the nominal operator.
//     The reduction operation must write the result(s) to this memory, as
//     described below.
//   count:
//     This is the number of "fields" on which to perform the reduction, and
//     thus the length of the accessible memory at 'arg1' and 'arg2_and_out'
//     is equal to 'count' times the size of each element (passed as 'dt_sz'
//     at initiation of the reduction).
//     Note that this argument may take on any positive value, which may be
//     either smaller or larger than the 'dt_cnt' passed at initiation of
//     the reduction.
//   cdata:
//     This is the value of the 'user_cdata' argument passed locally at
//     initiation of the reduction, and is intended to assist in implementing
//     more than a single data type and/or operation with a common C function.
//
// The function implementing a user-defined reduction operation:
// + May use the 'cdata' argument to receive information (such as the
//   operation or data type) not provided by the other arguments.
// + May assume 'arg1' and 'arg2_and_out' do not overlap each other.  However,
//   they can overlap the 'src' buffer (and 'dst' buffer, if any) passed at
//   operation initiation.
// + May perform the element-wise operations in any order, and parallel
//   computation is explicitly permitted.
// + Shall interpret the 'arg1' and 'arg2_and_out' as arrays of length 'count'
//   with an element type corresponding to the data type passed at initiation
//   of the reduction.
// + Shall apply the desired operation element-wise to each of the 'count'
//   pairs of operands, storing the result in the location from which the
//   second (right-hand) operand is retrieved.  Here "element-wise"
//   application can be expressed in pseudo-code as follows, using 'T' to
//   denote the C data type and '(+)' to denote the operator:
//     T* x = (T*)arg1;
//     T* y = (T*)arg2_and_out;
//     For all i in [0..count) do y[i] = x[i] (+) y[i];
// + Shall not assume 'count' is equal to the 'dt_cnt' passed at operation
//   initiation, since the implementation is free to process the 'dt_cnt'
//   elements passed in at initiation in smaller groups, or to group more
//   than 'dt_cnt' pairs of operands into a single call to the user's
//   function.
// + Shall not block pending any condition the satisfaction of which is
//   dependent on progress in GASNet (whether local or global).
// + Shall not make any GASNet calls other than those enumerated as permitted
//   while holding a handler-safe lock, in the section "Calls from restricted
//   context"
// + Shall not assume that the executing thread was created by the client.
// + Shall allow for the possibility that the implementation invokes the
//   function concurrent with itself, even if the client has not spawned
//   threads.  Use of handler-safe locks or GASNet-Tools atomics are
//   recommended mechanisms to deal with any access to global/persistent
//   state.

// User-Defined Data Types
//
// Reductions on types without a corresponding built-in data type (GEX_DT_*)
// constant are supported by passing GEX_DT_USER as the 'dt' when initiating a
// reduction.  In this case data elements are treated as indivisible byte
// sequences with length given as 'dt_sz' at initiation of the reduction.
// Reduction operations passing GEX_DT_USER for the data type must pass either
// GEX_OP_USER or GEX_OP_USER_NC for the operation.

// Limitations for Built-in Data Types
//
// + Operations on floating-point data types are not guaranteed to obey all
//   rules in the IEEE 754 standard even when the C float and double types
//   otherwise do conform.  Deviations from IEEE 754 include (at least):
//     - Operations on signalling NaNs have undefined behavior.
//     - MIN and MAX *may* be performed as if on "sign and magnitude
//       representation integers" of the same width, resulting in
//       non-conforming behavior with quiet NaNs.
//       (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985, and especially
//       the section "Comparing_floating-point_numbers")
//   [THIS PARAGRAPH MAY NOT BE A COMPLETE LIST OF NON-IEEE BEHAVIORS]

//
// The following argument descriptions are applicable to all computational
// collective APIs in this section using arguments with these names.
//
// src:
//      The local address of the caller's input buffer.
//      This is not a single-valued parameter.
// dst:
//      The local address of the caller's output buffer, if any.
//      This is not a single-valued parameter.
// dt:
//      The data type for the reduction operation.
//      Must be a GEX_DT_* constant documented as valid for Reductions.
//      This is a single-valued parameter.
// dt_sz:
//      The length in bytes of one element of data.
//      When 'dt' is a built-in type, this value must be the size in bytes of
//      the corresponding built-in C type.  When 'dt' is GEX_DT_USER, this
//      value must be the size in bytes of the user-defined data type.
//      This length must be non-zero.
//      This is a single-valued parameter.
// dt_cnt:
//      The per-rank count of data elements to reduce (not a length in bytes).
//      This count must be non-zero.
//      This is a single-valued parameter.
// op:
//      The opcode, of type gex_OP_t, naming the reduction operator.
//      Must be a GEX_OP_* constant documented as valid for Reductions.
//      This is a single-valued parameter.
// user_op, user_cdata:
//      If 'op' is neither GEX_OP_USER nor GEX_OP_USER_NC, then these two
//      arguments are ignored.  Otherwise 'user_op' is a local function
//      pointer of type gex_Coll_ReduceFn_t (described above), and
//      'user_cdata' is a client data pointer to be passed to each local
//      invocation of 'user_op'.  The 'user_cdata' is treated as opaque by the
//      implementation and therefore is not required to be a pointer to valid
//      memory.  In particular, it may be NULL.
// flags:
//      A bitwise OR of zero or more of permitted GEX_FLAG_* constants.
//      Currently no flags are defined for computational collective
//      operations, and the value zero should be passed.
//      However, a future release will support the "segment disposition"
//      flags [UNIMPLEMENTED].
//      Individual flags bits may or may not be single-valued, as will
//      be documented with each supported flag.

// Common Semantics
//
// All reductions are performed via an unspecified pattern of applications of
// the operator to pairs of operands, under the assumptions that (1) all
// operations are mathematically associative and (2) operations other than
// GEX_OP_USER_NC are mathematically commutative.
//
// The implementation is not required to take measures to accommodate any
// divergence (for instance of IEEE floating-point arithmetic) from the
// assumptions in the preceding paragraph.  Specifically, in the presence of
// such divergence, the implementation is not required to provide equality of
// the results of calls with mathematically equivalent arguments; neither
// between distinct calls in the same execution, nor between the same call in
// distinct executions.  However, high-quality implementations will provide
// reproducibility among calls with the same parameters within a single
// execution (e.g. by applying the operation in a deterministic order).
//
// The implementation is not required to preserve the vector of 'dt_cnt'
// elements as an indivisible unit.  It is permitted not only to break the
// vector into shorter ones, but may also concatenate multiple vectors to
// lessen the number of calls to a user-defined reduction operator.
//
// This specification does not require that a user-defined function applies
// the semantically equivalent operation to every pair of inputs.  Nothing in
// this specification prohibits passing a different user-defined operator on
// each caller, nor does it prohibit a user-defined operator from applying a
// different operation depending on an element's location in the argument
// vectors.  However, both behaviors are strongly discouraged.  Since this
// specification explicitly permits the implementation freedom in the order of
// reductions in both rank and vector dimensions, either of these behaviors
// will result in unpredictable output values.  Nothing in this paragraph is
// intended to prohibit, or discourage use of, user-defined operations with
// behaviors which depend on characteristics encoded in a user-defined data
// type (which may include position in the rank or vector dimensions); the
// intent is to discourage operators which *infer* such position information.


// Reduction to one
//
// This is a collective call over the team named by the 'tm' argument that
// initiates a non-blocking reduction applying the operation denoted by 'op'
// repeatedly to reduce a collection of operands of type denoted by 'dt'.
// Each member of 'tm' provides a 'src' vector of length 'dt_cnt' (in
// elements), and the elements are reduced element-wise such that the i'th
// element of the output vector is the reduction over the i'th elements of the
// 'src' vectors of all team members.  The result is written to the 'dst' of
// one 'root' rank.
//
// Using `(+)` to represent the nominal reduction operator, and `src_i[j]` to
// denote the i'th element of the 'src' vector passed by rank 'j', the result
// produced on the 'root' rank can be expressed as:
//     dst_i = src_i[0] (+) src_i[1] ... (+) src_i[N-1]
// where `N = gex_TM_QuerySize(tm)`.
//
// This call is non-blocking (may return before other team members have issued
// a corresponding call).
//
// On the 'root' rank the 'dst' buffer has length in bytes of 'dt_sz * dt_cnt'.
// The value of 'dst' is ignored on all other ranks.
//
// On all ranks the 'src' buffer has length in bytes of 'dt_sz * dt_cnt'.
//
// On the 'root' rank, it is permitted that 'src' and 'dst' be equal.
// However, any other overlap between 'src' and 'dst' buffers on the root rank
// yields undefined behavior.
//
// LIMITATIONS of the current release:
//  + The current implementation may limit `dt_sz` for user-defined types to as
//    little as 32KB bytes in some configurations and with default parameters.
//    The precise limit depends on the network and sizes of the job and team.
