The psm-conduit is now DEPRECATED.
No further development of this conduit is anticipated.
It may be removed in a future release.

Users of Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric are recommended to use ofi-conduit
by passing the following to GASNet's configure script.
  --enable-ofi --disable-psm --disable-ibv

User Information:
-----------------

This conduit is designed to communicate for the Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric
through the Intel(r) Performance Scaled Messaging 2 (PSM2) Linux user space
library Application Programming Interface (API). Mainly intended to use the
Active Messaging PSM2 API, but will use PSM2 matched queues for long messages
(see section "Tuning use of PSM2 Matched Queues" below).

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

The default spawner to be used by the gasnetrun_psm utility can be
selected by configuring '--with-psm-spawner=VALUE', where VALUE is one
of 'mpi', 'pmi' or 'ssh'.  If this option is not used, mpi is the
default when available, and ssh otherwise.
Here are some things to consider when selecting a default spawner:
  + mpi-spawner is the default when MPI is available precisely because it
    is so frequently present on systems where GASNet is to be installed.
    Additionally, very little (if any) configuration is required and the
    behavior is highly reliable.
  + pmi-spawner uses the same "Process Management Interface" which forms
    the basis for many mpirun implementations.  When support is available,
    this spawner can be as easy to use and as reliable as mpi-spawner, but
    without the overheads of initializing an MPI runtime.
  + ssh-spawner depends only on the availability of a remote shell command
    such as ssh.  For this reason ssh-spawner support is always compiled.
    However, it can be difficult (or impossible) to use on a cluster which
    was not setup to allow ssh to (and among) its compute nodes.
For more information on configuration and use of these spawners, see
   README-{ssh,mpi,pmi}-spawner (installed)
or
   other/{ssh,mpi,pmi}-spawner/README (source).

Job Spawning:
-------------

If using UPC, Titanium, etc. the language-specific commands should be used
to launch applications.  Otherwise, applications can be launched using
the gasnetrun_psm utility:
  + usage summary:
    gasnetrun_psm -n <n> [options] [--] prog [program args]
    options:
      -n <n>                 number of processes to run (required)
      -N <N>                 number of nodes to run on (not supported by all MPIs)
      -E <VAR1[,VAR2...]>    list of environment vars to propagate
      -v                     be verbose about what is happening
      -t                     test only, don't execute anything (implies -v)
      -k                     keep any temporary files created (implies -v)
      -spawner=(ssh|mpi|pmi) force use of a specific spawner (if available)

There are as many as three possible methods (ssh, mpi and pmi) by which one
can launch an psm-conduit application.  Ssh-based spawning is always
available, and mpi- and pmi-based spawning are available if the respective
support was located at configure time.  The default is established at
configure time (see section "Optional compile-time settings").

To select a non-default spawner one may either use the "-spawner=" command-
line argument or set the environment variable GASNET_PSM_SPAWNER to "ssh",
"mpi" or "pmi".  If both are used, then the command line argument takes
precedence.

Using psm-conduit with MPI:
---------------------------

PSM has a restriction in which only one endpoint may be opened per process.
For users of this conduit, this means that if an MPI is used for process
spawning, that MPI must NOT also attempt to use PSM for communication.

If compiled with PSM support (such as the openmpi_gcc_hfi RPM package
distributed with Intel Fabric Suite package), Open MPI will try to use
PSM by default.  To override, set the MPIRUN_CMD variable.
With Open MPI, for example:

export MPIRUN_CMD="mpirun -np %N -mca mtl ^psm,psm2 %P %A"

The above disables both the psm (v1) and psm2 MTLs. Then gasnetrun_psm can be
used as normal; Open MPI will select another network such as verbs and/or TCP.

An alternative is to use an MPI without PSM support enabled, for example MPICH.

Additional information on this topic is available in the mpi-spawner README.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

* GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT, GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT_MAX, GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT_MIN, and
  GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT_FACTOR are supported as described in the top-level README.
  In addition to exit timeout, these values are also used for a per-peer
  connection establishment timeout.  Except for FACTOR, all variables are
  specified in seconds.  The PSM-specific defaults are:

  GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT_MAX=300
  GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT_MIN=5
  GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT_FACTOR=0.01 (1 second per 100 nodes)

* GASNET_RCV_THREAD: psm-conduit has a progress thread that is used to poll 
  active message communication through the PSHM (shared-memory) path, and to 
  advance network operations using the PSM/MQ path. GASNET_RCV_THREAD controls 
  this GASNet psm-conduit thread. The PSM2 layer itself runs a progress thread 
  to service network communication, and PSM_RCVTHREAD controls this PSM2-level thread.  
  Both are boolean values, where "0" disables and "1" enables.
  Both progress threads are enabled by default.

* GASNET_RCV_THREAD_RATE controls the frequency at which the psm-conduit thread
  wakes and polls for progress.  The unit is polls per second, and the default
  is 1000.

* GASNET_THREAD_STACK_MIN, GASNET_THREAD_STACK_PAD are supported as described
  in the top-level README, and affect the psm-conduit's progress thread.

* GASNET_LONG_MSG_THRESHOLD  Message size in bytes at which a PSM/MQ-based
  long message protocol is used instead of repeated single-MTU active messages.
  Applies to all forms of the Extended Put and GET operations; this option has
  no effect on Core API active messages. 
  See section "Tuning use of PSM2 Matched Queues" below for more info.

+ GASNET_PSM_SPAWNER
  To override the default spawner for psm-conduit jobs, one may set this
  environment variable as described in the section "Job Spawning", above.
  There are additional settings which control behaviors of the various
  spawners, as described in the respective READMEs (listed in section
  "Optional compile-time settings", above).

Tuning use of PSM2 Matched Queues
---------------------------------

In PSM2, Matched Queues (MQ) present a queue-based communication model with
the distinction that queue consumers use a 3-tuple of metadata to match
incoming messages against a list of preposted receive buffers.  On the other
hand, the Active Message (AM) component presents a request/reply model where
the arrival of a message triggers the execution of consumer-provided handler
code. This can be used to implement many one-sided and two-sided
communications paradigms. More information regarding AM and different
protocols employed under MQ can be found in PSM2 documentation.

The PSM2 environment variable PSM2_MQ_RNDV_HFI_THRESH provides the switch over
point from MQ Eager to MQ Rendezvous protocol. This is an internal PSM2
protocol switch. Currently by the default switch over point is 64000B for
Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor and 200000B on Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) processor.
GASNet environment variable GASNET_LONG_MSG_THRESHOLD provides the message size
at which the psm-conduit will switch over from AM to MQ. The default value for
GASNET_LONG_MSG_THRESHOLD is 16384B. The below table shows the different
protocols used by default in psm-conduit and PSM2 for different message sizes:
  Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor:
  Lower limit  <  message size < upper limit    : PSM2 API used by the psm-conduit (PSM2 internal protocol)
           0B  <  message size <= 16000B        : AM API (Eager PIO protocol)
       16000B  <  message size <  16384B        : AM API (Eager SDMA protocol)
       16384B  <= message size <= 64000B        : MQ API (Eager SDMA protocol)
       64000B  <  message size <= PSM2_MQ_RNDV_HFI_WINDOW : MQ API (RNDV SDMA protocol)

  Intel(R) Xeon Phi(TM) processor:
  Lower limit  <  message size < upper limit    : PSM2 API used by the psm-conduit (PSM2 internal protocol)
           0B  <  message size <  16384B        : AM API (Eager PIO protocol)
       16384B  <= message size <= 65536B        : MQ API (Eager PIO protocol)
       65536B  <  message size <= 200000B       : MQ API (Eager SDMA protocol)
      200000B  <  message size <= PSM2_MQ_RNDV_HFI_WINDOW : MQ API (RNDV SDMA protocol)

For optimal performance it is recommended to keep the defaults. However, it is
possible to force the MQ path to use only RNDV protocol by setting
PSM2_MQ_RNDV_HFI_THRESH to the same value as GASNET_LONG_MSG_THRESHOLD.

Known problems:
---------------

* Bug 3333
  At the time of this release, there is a known bug in the AM interface of
  the shared-memory device in (at least) the 0.7-244 release of the PSM2
  libraries.  This bug can manifest with psm-conduit only if GASNet's own
  process-shared memory (PSHM) support is not in use, as can happen if PSHM
  was disabled at configure time or has been limited to subsets of processes
  by setting GASNET_SUPERNODE_MAXSIZE.  Under those conditions, you will
  receive an error message which directs you here.
  The most up-to-date information on this bug is maintained at:
    http://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3333
  If, after reviewing that bug report, you wish to run psm-conduit over the
  PSM2 shared-memory device, please set GASNET_PSM_ENABLE_SHM=1 in your
  environment to disable the error message.  We strongly recommend you set
  this variable only if you have determined that you have a fixed release of
  PSM2, or if you apply a patch (in the bug report) that works-around the
  problem (at the cost of reduced performance).

* Bug 3419
  At the time of this release, there is a known issue in which nodes may
  report different values for the maximum size of a PSM2 active message.
  The psm-conduit is not currently able to deal with this situation, and
  under those conditions you will receive an error message which directs
  you here.
  The most up-to-date information on this bug is maintained at:
    http://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3419
  Note this problem seems especially likely to arise when running on a KNL
  architecture with a heterogenous configuration of KNL memory/cluster modes
  across the nodes comprising a job. We recommend that all nodes comprising
  a GASNet job be configured to use the same KNL memory/cluster mode.

* The default limit for number of inflight isend and irecv MQ requests in
  PSM2 is 1048576. If the user encounters exhaustion of the isend or irecv
  descriptors (see error message below), it is possible to extend the MQ size by
  setting the environment variable as "PSM2_MEMORY=large". This will increase the
  inflight isend and irecv limit to 16777216.
  A different way to independently configure the number of sends or
  receives inflight is by setting the PSM2_MQ_{SEND,RECV}REQS_MAX environment
  variables (PSM2_MEMORY internally sets both).
  Example error message:
  `Exhausted 1048576 MQ isend request descriptors, which usually indicates a user
  program error or insufficient request descriptors (PSM2_MQ_SENDREQS_MAX=1048576)`

* See the GASNet Bugzilla server for details on other known bugs:
