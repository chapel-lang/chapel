This directory contains a stripped down version of a GASNet conduit with just
enough to test the conduit-independent bootstrappers.

It is not meant to be built as part of a GASNet conduit and is simply used as
a debug mechanism for the ssh and mpi spawners.

NOTE: This code has not been maintained and does not currently build.
