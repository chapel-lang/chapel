   * On master processor, this call will never return if successful. 
   * Instead, it will block for the duration of the job and behave as the console
   * It will call the spawnfn with the proper argc/argv to be used in spawning the worker threads
   * On worker processors, this call will modify the argc/argv params, call AM_Init,
   * and then return a bundle and endpoint properly configured for use with the SPMD job 
   * (translation table will be filled in, AM_SetExpectedResources called, and each worker given a unique tag)
   * worker processors should setup handler table for the endpoint and call SPMDBarrier before starting communication
   * Arguments:
   *  argc/argv - should be the unchanged ones passed to main, may return changed
   *  nproc - the number of SPMD worker processors. 0 to read from arguments (ignored on workers)
   *  networkdepth - desired network depth hint (0 for default) (ignored on workers)
   *  spawnfn - callback function to be used in spawning workers from the master  (ignored on workers)
   *    this function may do arbitrary work, but the end result must be that nproc worker processes 
   *    are created somewhere on the accessible network, which then subsequently call AMUDP_SPMDStartup with the given args
   *    the worker processes created MUST be all be in different address spaces (i.e. can't just create a thread)
   *    may be one of special functions provided below (e.g. AMUDP_SPMDLocalSpawn)
   *    passing NULL will give the user a choice amongst the library-provided spawn functions
   *  networkpid - returns a globally unique pid for this job which is identical on all works (can be NULL for don't care) (ignored on master)
   *  eb, ep - variables to receive newly allocated bundle and endpoint on workers (ignored on master)
