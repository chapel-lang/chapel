External Software README
------------------------

This subdirectory contains various external libraries and tools
used by this GASNet implementation.

------------------------------------------------------------------
AMUDP

The amudp directory contains a snapshot of AMUDP, a software layer 
written by Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu> that provides 
AM2 functionality over UDP. The authoritative version of AMUDP
is located here:

http://gasnet.lbl.gov/amudp

If you make fixes or changes to the code in that directory, 
please email them to Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>.

------------------------------------------------------------------
AMMPI

The ammpi directory contains a snapshot of AMMPI, a software layer 
written by Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu> that provides 
AM2 functionality over MPI. The authoritative version of AMMPI
is located here:

http://gasnet.lbl.gov/ammpi

If you make fixes or changes to the code in that directory, 
please email them to Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>.

------------------------------------------------------------------
AMXTESTS

The amxtests directory contains the test suite for the stand-alone
AMUDP and AMMPI products.

------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTRIB

Various extra add-on tools which are useful in conjunction with
add-on tools. See individual files or subdirectories for licensing
and contact information.

------------------------------------------------------------------
FIREHOSE

The firehose directory contains an implementation of the firehose 
distributed page registration management algorithm described in:

C. Bell and D. Bonachea. "A New DMA Registration Strategy for 
Pinning-Based High Performance Networks", Workshop on Communication 
Architecture for Clusters (CAC'03), 2003. 

For more information, contact Christian Bell <csbell@cs.berkeley.edu>
or Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>.

------------------------------------------------------------------
PLPA

The plpa directory contains a modified subset of the source code to
the Portable Linux Processor Affinity (PLPA) library.  This software
is used to implement the GASNet processor-pinning calls on Linux
platforms.  See plpa/README for an expanded description.

The PLPA software is not a product of the GASNet development team.
However, if in doubt whether a specific problem is a bug in PLPA or
in the GASNet-specifc modification or usage, please report the
problem to the GASNet team (who will forward the bug report if
appropriate).

To file PLPA bug reports, for general information about PLPA, for
mailing lists, or for the full unmodified source, please see

http://www.open-mpi.org/software/plpa/

------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI-SPAWNER

The mpi-spawner directory contains an implementation of job-launch
and GASNet communications bootstrapping using MPI.  It is optionally
used by GASNet's ibv and mxm conduits.

------------------------------------------------------------------
SSH-SPAWNER

The ssh-spawner directory contains an implementation of job-launch
and GASNet communications bootstrapping using ssh.  It is optionally
used by GASNet's ibv and mxm conduits.

------------------------------------------------------------------
PMI-SPAWNER

The mpi-spawner directory contains an implementation of job-launch
and GASNet communications bootstrapping using MPI.  It is optionally
used by GASNet's ibv and mxm conduits, and unconditionally by
portals4, gemini and aries conduits.
