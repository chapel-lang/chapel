AMMPI is an implementation of the AM-2 specification over MPI-1.

AMMPI is a portable implementation of the AM-2 specification that runs on MPI-1.1
message-passing operations. It does not currently use MPI-RMA in any way.

The intent is a fully-portable implementation that will work on any system with
a compliant MPI implementation.  We don't expect to achieve latency performance
competitive with a native implementation of AM optimized for special-purpose
hardware, instead we seek to provide a compatibility layer that will allow
AM-based systems to quickly get up and running on any HPC platform. 

AMMPI is a production-quality AM layer that provides a number of features in
addition to the standard AM-2 API, including a helper library for SPMD job
startup and an API to access built-in networking utilization and performance
statistics. It has been successfully ported to a number of parallel
architectures, and porting to new architectures generally requires minimal
effort. AMMPI performs all its MPI calls on a separate, private MPI
communicator, which is strongly guaranteed by the MPI spec to isolate it from
any other MPI communication in the application, so there's never a possibility
of deadlock or hard-limit resource contention between the two.

AMMPI is used to implement the GASNet communication system (http://gasnet.lbl.gov).

Requirements
------------

* MPI 1.1 or later implementation, with a C99 compiler

* GNU Make and basic UNIX tools for the provided Makefiles

Limitations
-----------

AMMPI is a purely polling-based implementation of Active Messages, in that incoming
active messages are only serviced inside synchronous calls to the AMMPI library from
the local process. This can lead to increased latency for those requests when the local
node is inattentive to the network.

AMMPI has a few notable departures from the AM-2 specification:

* The client must call AM_SetExpectedResources() exactly once on an endpoint
  after setting up the translation table and before making any calls to the
  transport functions (AM_Poll, AM_Reply* or AM_Request*). It is also an error to
  call AM_Map, AM_MapAny or AM_Unmap (which change the translation table) after
  the call to AM_SetExpectedResources().

* AM_PAR bundle/endpoint access is not implemented - this means AMMPI does
  not provide thread safety, but can be used in a thread-funnelled mode with
  locking at the client level.

* AM_GetXferM is not implemented.

* Clients should not take the address of AM_ entry point "functions", because
  many are implemented as macros.
