User Information:
----------------
This is the README for ofi-conduit.

OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection of
libraries and applications used to export fabric services. 

See more details at: https://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/

This conduit is feature-complete and passes tests in recommended configurations.
Performance tuning is planned as future work.

Use of ofi-conduit is only recommended on certain networks (see next section).
Therefore, it is disabled by default in most systems.  It can be enabled
explicitly at configure time using either `--enable-ofi` or
`--enable-ofi=probe`.  Either option will enable ofi-conduit if `configure`
locates the prerequisites.  The difference is that the first option makes
failure to locate the prerequisites fatal in `configure`.

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

The GASNet OFI conduit requires libfabric 1.5 or newer.
Use with some providers requires higher minimum versions (see below).

The GASNet OFI conduit can run on any OFI provider that matches its
requirements. However, at this time, it is recommended *only* for the
following networks.

  + Intel or Cornelis Networks Omni-Path fabric, via the "psm2" provider
  + HPE Slingshot-10 (100 Gb/s ConnectX-5 NIC), via the "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider
  + HPE Slingshot-11 (200 Gb/s Cassini NIC), via the "cxi" provider
  + Cray Aries network, via the experimental "gni" provider

The following providers have been used successfully on networks where other
GASNet conduits are a more appropriate choice. Therefore we do not recommend
use of these providers in general.

  + TCP, via the "sockets" provider
  + UDP, via the "udp;ofi_rxd" provider

The following providers have not met our expectations (with respect to
performance or stability) when tested on the listed networks and therefore are
not currently recommended at all.

  + TCP, via the "tcp;ofi_rxm" provider
  + InfiniBand, via "verbs;ofi_rxm" provider

Independent of recommendations above for or against use of any given provider,
the following are minimum libfabric versions below which ofi-conduit will
reject certain providers due to known correctness defects in older versions
impacting GASNet stability:

  + "udp;ofi_rxd"     1.7
  + "verbs;ofi_rxm"   1.12  (1.11 with HPE Slingshot-10)
  + "gni"             1.14
  + "tcp;ofi_rxm"     1.15

Providers not listed above are accepted from the higher of 1.5 or the first
libfabric release in which they appear.

The following providers have passed correctness and performance sanity checks
at some point in time.  However, due to lack of access for periodic testing, we
cannot consider these to be supported at this time:

  + AWS Elastic Fabric Adapter, via "efa" provider

The ofi-conduit is currently known to lack support for the following providers
as of libfabric v1.14.0. If these providers are important to you, please
contact us at gasnet-staff@lbl.gov .

  + "psm" provider for the (end-of-life) True Scale products
  + "opx" provider, an alternative to "psm2" for the Omni-Path fabric

The fi_info command installed with libfabric can be used to query the available
OFI providers on your system.  It is worth noting that the available providers
on a cluster compute node may differ from those on a front-end node.

Users with NVIDIA/Mellanox InfiniBand hardware should use the GASNet ibv-conduit,
rather than ofi-conduit with the verbs OFI provider, as the former may provide
better performance.

Users with InfiniBand hardware with an InfiniPath HCA (PathScale or Qlogic) or
True Scale HCA (Intel) should use the GASNet mpi-conduit, rather than
ofi-conduit with the verbs OFI provider, as the former may provide better
performance.

Users with Ethernet hardware are encouraged to consider the GASNet udp-conduit
as an alternative to ofi-conduit with the sockets or udp;ofi_rxd providers, as
the former may provide more favorable performance.

Users with Cray XC hardware are advised that while the GASNet maintainers have
seen good results from preliminary testing of the gni provider with GASNet's
ofi-conduit, nobody has thoroughly validated it.  Therefore, use of the gni
provider with ofi-conduit should be considered experimental.  Additionally,
lack of access means this provider has not been tested since the 2023.3.0
release of GASNet-EX.  However, it is recommended over use of mpi-conduit.

The ofi-conduit includes support for memory kinds (`GEX_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA` and
`GASNET_HAVE_MK_CLASS_HIP`) for certain providers and subject to minimum
versions of libfabric.  See docs/memory_kinds_implementation.md in the
GASNet-EX sources for details.

OFI provider requirements to run this conduit:
-------------------------------------
The provider MUST support all of the following:
    * API version 1.5 or newer
    * API version 1.9 or newer if the client will use `gex_MK_Create()`
    * endpoint type FI_EP_RDM
    * capability FI_RMA
    * capability FI_MSG for at least two endpoints per process
    * capability FI_HMEM if the client will use `gex_MK_Create()`
    * capability FI_MULTI_RECV unless GASNET_OFI_RECEIVE_BUFF_SIZE=recv
    * threading mode FI_THREAD_SAFE and/or FI_THREAD_DOMAIN (more info below)
The provider MUST NOT require any of the following:
    * FI_MR_LOCAL
    * FI_MR_ALLOCATED in GASNET_SEGMENT_EVERYTHING mode
    * FI_CONTEXT for FI_RMA endpoints
    * FI_CONTEXT2
    * FI_MSG_PREFIX
    * FI_RESTRICTED_COMP
The provider MAY require any of the following:
    * address vector type FI_AV_TABLE and/or FI_AV_MAP
    * FI_MR_ENDPOINT
    * FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR (performance may differ with or without)
    * FI_MR_PROV_KEY (performance may differ with or without)
    * FI_RX_CQ_DATA (no operations for which this matters)
    * FI_ASYNC_IOV (no operations for which this matters)
    * that at most one endpoint be associated with any given completion queue
    * (this list is incomplete)
Threading mode: FI_THREAD_SAFE and/or FI_THREAD_DOMAIN
    * In GASNET_SEQ and GASNET_PARSYNC modes, ofi-conduit uses FI_THREAD_DOMAIN
      since these modes ensure serialization of calls into libfabric.
    * By default in GASNET_PAR mode, FI_THREAD_SAFE is used with most providers
      to allow concurrent calls into libfabric.  The sole exception is the psm2
      provider which defaults to FI_THREAD_DOMAIN due to a lack of
      FI_THREAD_SAFE support.
      See the description of --{en,dis}able-ofi-thread-domain, below, for
      the means to override these defaults.

Building ofi-conduit
--------------------

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. To use ofi-conduit, the user firsts needs to 
locate or build an install of libfabric. The source code of libfabric can be found at:

   https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric

To build GASNet with ofi-conduit enabled, the minimum requirement is
  [path to]/configure --enable-ofi

The following configure options are also available:

    * --with-ofi-home=INSTALL_PREFIX
      Used to provide the libfabric install prefix.
      If not used, the default is based on the location of fi_info in $PATH.
      If fi_info is not found in $PATH, then this option is required.

    * --with-ofi-provider=PROVIDER_NAME
      Since different providers expose different feature sets, ofi-conduit will
      use compile-time knowledge of the intended provider to elide unneeded
      code.  This option can be used to name the provider to optimize for.
      If this option is not present, the configure script will attempt to detect
      an available provider using the fi_info utility, if available.
      If fi_info is not available, or no supported provider is listed by fi_info,
      or if the argument to this option is "generic", then provider features
      will be detected at runtime. While this is flexible as to which providers
      it supports, it will add branches in critical paths that may increase
      software overheads.  This case is referred to as "generic provider" below.

      Note that some providers, such as "verbs;ofi_rxm" include a semi-colon in
      their name.  To avoid issues with shell quoting, the configure script will
      allow substitution of a colon for the semi-colon (e.g. "verbs:ofi_rxm") as
      well as use of just the first word (e.g. "verbs") if no ambiguity would
      result.

    * --with-ofi-num-completions=VALUE
      Specifies the maximum number of transmit completions to be read from the
      transmit CQ during each call to the polling function.
      Default: 64

    * --with-ofi-max-medium=VALUE
      This option specifies the default value of the environment variable
      GASNET_OFI_MAX_MEDIUM, which in turn determines the value returned
      by gex_AM_LUB{Request,Reply}Medium().
      The value cannot be less than 512.
      Default: 8192

The following configure flags override options set by provider selection via
auto-detection or by the --with-ofi-provider=PROVIDER_NAME option. These are not
recommended to be used as tuning options.

    * --enable-ofi-thread-domain
      Forces the use of FI_THREAD_DOMAIN in GASNET_PAR mode.
      This results in one global lock to protect all calls into libfabric.
      This is the default for psm2 provider.
    * --disable-ofi-thread-domain
      Forces the use of FI_THREAD_SAFE in GASNET_PAR mode.
      This is the default for most providers and for the generic provider case.

      In GASNET_SEQ and GASNET_PARSYNC modes, the two options above have no
      effect.

    * --enable-ofi-mr-virt-addr
      Indicates that FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR memory registration support will be
      compiled into the conduit.
    * --disable-ofi-mr-virt-addr
      Indicates that FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR memory registration support not will
      be compiled into the conduit.

      Currently only "verbs;ofi_rxm" and "gni" providers default to use of
      FI_MR_VIRT_ADDR.

      For the generic provider case, the determination is made at runtime.

    * --enable-ofi-mr-prov-key
      Indicates that FI_MR_PROV_KEY memory registration support will be
      compiled into the conduit.
    * --disable-ofi-mr-prov-key
      Indicates that FI_MR_PROV_KEY memory registration support not will
      be compiled into the conduit.

      Currently only "verbs;ofi_rxm" and "gni" providers default to use of
      FI_MR_PROV_KEY.

      For the generic provider case, the determination is made at runtime.

    * --enable-ofi-mr-scalable [DEPRECATED]
      This deprecated option is an alias for
        --disable-ofi-mr-virt-addr --disable-ofi-mr-prov-key
      and corresponds to the legacy FI_MR_SCALABLE memory registration mode.
    * --disable-ofi-mr-scalable [DEPRECATED]
      This deprecated option is an alias for
        --enable-ofi-mr-virt-addr --enable-ofi-mr-prov-key
      and corresponds to the legacy FI_MR_BASIC memory registration mode.

      These options are IGNORED in the presence of any of the following options:
        --disable-ofi-mr-virt-addr --enable-ofi-mr-virt-addr
        --disable-ofi-mr-prov-key  --enable-ofi-mr-prov-key

      These options may be removed in a future release.

    * --enable-ofi-av-map
      Indicates that only support for address vector type FI_AV_MAP will be
      compiled into the conduit.
    * --disable-ofi-av-map
      Indicates that only support for address vector type FI_AV_TABLE will
      be compiled into the conduit.

      Currently all providers default to use of FI_AV_TABLE.

      For the generic provider case, the determination is made at runtime.

    * --enable-ofi-multi-cq
      Indicates that the provider requires the use of distinct completion
      queues for the transmit completions of each endpoint.
      This is the default option for the cxi provider.
    * --disable-ofi-multi-cq
      Indicates that the provider supports the use of a single completion
      queue for the transmit completions of multiple endpoints.
      This is the default (and recommended) option for most providers.

      For the generic provider case, the logic for Cq creation and polling
      adapts at runtime to use a single completion queue if possible, and uses
      multiple Cqs only if necessary.

    * --enable-ofi-retry-recvmsg
      Enables logic in ofi-conduit to handle the provider returning `-FI_EAGAIN`
      from `fi_recvmsg()`.
      This is the default option for the cxi and udp;ofi_rxd providers and for
      the generic provider case.
    * --disable-ofi-retry-recvmsg
      Disable logic to handle `-FI_EAGAIN` returns from `fi_recvmsg()`.
      This is the default (and recommended) option for most providers.


The default spawner to be used by the gasnetrun_ofi utility can be
selected by configuring '--with-ofi-spawner=VALUE', where VALUE is one
of 'mpi', 'pmi' or 'ssh'.  If this option is not used, mpi is the
default when available, and ssh otherwise.
Here are some things to consider when selecting a default spawner:
  + The choice of spawner only affects the protocol used for parallel job
    setup and teardown; in particular it is NOT used to implement any part
    of the steady-state GASNet communication operations. As such, the
    selected protocol needs to be stable and co-exist with GASNet
    communication, but its performance efficiency is usually not a
    practical consideration.
  + mpi-spawner is the default when MPI is available precisely because it
    is so frequently present on systems where GASNet is to be installed.
    Additionally, very little (if any) configuration is required and the
    behavior is highly reliable.
  + pmi-spawner uses the same "Process Management Interface" which forms
    the basis for many mpirun implementations.  When support is available,
    this spawner can be as easy to use and as reliable as mpi-spawner, but
    without the overheads of initializing an MPI runtime.
  + ssh-spawner depends only on the availability of a remote shell command
    such as ssh.  For this reason ssh-spawner support is always compiled.
    However, it can be difficult (or impossible) to use on a cluster which
    was not setup to allow ssh to (and among) its compute nodes.
For more information on configuration and use of these spawners, see
   README-{ssh,mpi,pmi}-spawner (installed)
or
   other/{ssh,mpi,pmi}-spawner/README (source).

Depending on the libfabric provider in use, there may be restrictions on how
mpi-based spawning is used. For instance, the psm2 provider has the property
that each process may only open the network adapter once. Additionally, if the
MPI implementation also uses libfabric for communication, then there is a risk
it may adjust settings in a way incompatible with ofi-conduit. If you wish to
use mpi-spawner, please consult its README for advice on how to set your
MPIRUN_CMD to use native TCP/IP to avoid these potential problems.

Job Spawning
------------

If using UPC++, Chapel, etc. the language-specific commands should be used
to launch applications.  Otherwise, applications can be launched using
the gasnetrun_ofi utility:
  + usage summary:
    gasnetrun_ofi -n <n> [options] [--] prog [program args]
    options:
      -n <n>                 number of processes to run (required)
      -N <N>                 number of nodes to run on (not always supported)
      -c <n>                 number of cpus per process (not always supported)
      -E <VAR1[,VAR2...]>    list of environment vars to propagate
      -v                     be verbose about what is happening
      -t                     test only, don't execute anything (implies -v)
      -k                     keep any temporary files created (implies -v)
      -spawner=<name>        force use of a specific spawner ([supported spawners])
      --                     ends option parsing

There are as many as three possible methods (ssh, mpi and pmi) by which one
can launch an ofi-conduit application.  Ssh-based spawning is always
available, and mpi- and pmi-based spawning are available if the respective
support was located at configure time.  The default is established at
configure time (see section "Building ofi-conduit", above).

To select a non-default spawner one may either use the "-spawner=" command-
line argument or set the environment variable GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER to "ssh",
"mpi" or "pmi".  If both are used, then the command line argument takes
precedence.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER
  To override the default spawner for ofi-conduit jobs, one may set this
  environment variable as described in the section "Job Spawning", above.
  There are additional settings which control behaviors of the various
  spawners, as described in the respective READMEs (listed in section
  "Building ofi-conduit", above).

* GASNET_QUIET - set to 1 to silence the startup warning indicating
  the provider in use may deliver suboptimal performance.

* GASNET_OFI_RMA_POLL_FREQ - In order to ensure efficient progress, the conduit polls the RMA
  transmit completion queue once for every GASNET_OFI_RMA_POLL_FREQ RMA injections. Default: 32

* GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS, GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE, GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD - See the
  "Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions" section for detail on these environment variables.

* GASNET_OFI_NUM_RECEIVE_BUFFS and GASNET_OFI_RECEIVE_BUFF_SIZE - Active Message
  receive resources. These two settings control, respectively, the number and
  size of the "multi-receive" buffers allocated for the reception of in-bound
  AMs.  Depending on the given provider's implementation of `FI_MULTI_RECV`,
  increasing these may improve AM throughput or have no impact.  On some
  providers, reducing these may severely reduce AM throughput or even lead to
  crashes.  Defaults: 8 and 1M
  See also: Bug 4461 and Bug 4517 under "Known problems"

* GASNET_OFI_AM_INJECT_LIMIT - limit on size of fi_inject() payload.
  GASNet Active Messages of total size (at the ofi level) no larger than this
  parameter value will be sent using fi_inject(), and larger messages are sent
  using fi_send().  Use of fi_inject() reduces the overall complexity of the
  operation by ensuring the data is consumed synchronously, usually at the
  cost of an extra copy.  Meanwhile, fi_send() consumes the data asynchronously,
  eliminating the extra copy at the expense of signaling an asynchronous local
  completion.  This setting does not affect payload local completion semantics
  at the GASNet API level.
  It too large a value is requested, it will be reduced to the maximum which
  the OFI provider can support.
  Default: largest size supported by the provider.
  NOTE: If this parameter is not set, then "GASNET_OFI_INJECT_LIMIT" is
  accepted as an alias.

* GASNET_OFI_RMA_INJECT_LIMIT - limit on size of RMA with FI_INJECT
  GASNet RMA put operations no larger than this size may be issued using the
  `FI_INJECT` flag to ensure the data is consumed synchronously.  This can
  reduce the overall complexity of operations using `GEX_EVENT_NOW`, typically
  at cost of an extra copy.  This setting does not affect local completion
  semantics at the GASNet API level.
  It too large a value is requested, it will be reduced to the maximum which
  the OFI provider can support.
  Default: largest size supported by the provider.

* GASNET_OFI_TX_CQ_SIZE and GASNET_OFI_RX_CQ_SIZE - limits on completion queue
  length. These settings control the length of the completion queues (CQs) used
  for transmit and receive operations, respectively.  The default of zero allows
  the provider to determine the length. Use of this default is recommended unless
  debugging a possible Cq overrun.

* GASNET_OFI_MAX_REQUEST_BUFFS and GASNET_OFI_MAX_REPLY_BUFFS - limits on the
  number of buffers allocated for the construction of out-bound AM Requests and
  Replies, respectively. The default for both settings is 1024.

* GASNET_OFI_NUM_INITIAL_REQUEST_BUFFS and GASNET_OFI_NUM_INITIAL_REPLY_BUFFS -
  the number of buffers to allocate at startup for the construction of
  out-bound AM Requests and Replies, respectively. If these values are lower
  than the corresponding "MAX" values (described immediately above) then the
  difference *may* be allocated dynamically, but only as needed.
  The default for each setting is the smaller of 256 or the respective MAX.
  In other words: with all defaults, 256 buffers are allocated to each pool and
  each poll is permitted to grow as large as 1024 buffers if the demand exists.

* GASNET_OFI_MAX_MEDIUM - maximum AM Medium payload size
  This setting determines the size of buffers used for AM Mediums, and thus the
  return value of the gex_AM_LUB{Request,Reply}Medium() queries.
  The value cannot be less than 512.
  Unless a different value was set using --with-ofi-max-medium=[value] at
  configure time, the default value is 8192.

* GASNET_OFI_SET_UNIVERSE_SIZE - enable automatic setting of FI_UNIVERSE_SIZE
  Setting GASNET_OFI_SET_UNIVERSE_SIZE=1 *allows* ofi-conduit to set
  FI_UNIVERSE_SIZE to the job size *if* it is not already set.
  Under no circumstances does ofi-conduit overwrite a pre-existing value.
  The default value is 1, unless using a libfabric version older than 1.15.2.0
  together with the "cxi" or "generic" provider (due to bug 4413).

* GASNET_OFI_DEVICE
  By default, ofi-conduit will open and use the first device enumerated by
  libfabric as matching the specified provider and required capabilities.
  This setting can be used to specify a device to be used in place of this
  default.
  See 'GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES' and 'GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES_NODES' for how
  to enumerate available devices.
  See also 'GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_*', immediately below.

* GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_*
  The environment variable 'GASNET_OFI_DEVICE', described immediately above,
  provides only a single setting and unless one uses some external means to
  give per-process settings, this cannot provide per-process control.  This
  can make it difficult to get the best performance from multi-rail systems
  with multiple processes per node and architectural locality properties that
  affect PCI/adapter access efficiency.
  See "topology-aware environment variable families" in GASNet's top-level
  README for a description of how 'GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_TYPE' can be used to
  establish process-specific values for 'GASNET_OFI_DEVICE'.
  As a concrete example, on OLCF's Crusher there are four NICs -- one per NUMA
  Node.  Examining the corresponding Quick Start Guide one can construct the
  following settings to ensure processes bound to cores in a single NUMA Node
  will use the topologically nearest NIC:
      GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_TYPE=Node
      GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_0=cxi2
      GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_1=cxi1
      GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_2=cxi3
      GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_3=cxi0
  These specific recommendations are appropriate to the specific composition
  of a node of OLCF's Crusher, and should not be considered as generic advice
  for use of all multi-NIC systems.
  Of course, even on the same system, your mileage may vary.
  By default 'GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_TYPE' is "Socket" and all other variables in
  this family are unset.
  There is currently no support for GASNET_OFI_DEVICE_TYPE == "Auto".

* GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES
  The value is a boolean: "0" to disable or "1" to enable the reporting of
  all supportable provider/device pairs.  In this context, "supportable"
  may be constrained by such factors as the configured provider or use of
  environment variables which constrain provider enumeration.
  If libhwloc 2.0 or higher was detected at configure time, then this output
  includes a distance ranking for each device for which the information can
  be found.  A ranking of "1" denotes the topologically nearest devices (i.e.
  "first place").  If present, "2" will denote any device(s) less near than the
  "1" device(s) but nearer than any "3"s, etc.  Note that ties are possible.
  This ranking of distance depends on libfabric's ability to provide device
  names (or PCI addresses) which hwloc can recognize, and thus may vary
  depending on the versions of hwloc and libfabric and on the provider in use.
  Currently, the status is as follows:
  + There are no known dependencies on hwloc version.
  + The `cxi`, `verbs`, `sockets`, `tcp` and `udp` providers are all believed
    to support applicable devices with their respective supported libfabric
    versions.
  + No version of the `psm2` provider (Omni-Path) supports distance ranking.
  + The status of the `gni` and `efa` providers are unknown.
  See 'GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES_NODES' for how to limit which nodes report.
  The default is "0" (no report).

* GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES_NODES
  If GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES is enabled, then this setting may be used to limit
  which nodes report providers/devices pairs.  The value is a list which may
  contain one or more integers or ranges separated by commas, such as
  "0,2-4,6".  If unset, empty, or equal to "*" then all nodes will report (if
  enabled by GASNET_OFI_LIST_DEVICES).
  The default is no limit on which nodes report.

* FI_PROVIDER - set to a provider name to override the default OFI provider selection
  Note that only in the "generic provider" case (described with the configure
  options) can this actually be used to change the provider to one different
  than selected at configure time.

* FI_UNIVERSE_SIZE - This libfabric variable conveys the number of ranks /
  peers a given process endpoint expects to communicate with (default: 256).
  This setting is not directly consumed by GASNet ofi-conduit, but affects the
  behavior of the underlying providers it relies upon.  Libfabric documentation
  encourages users to set this high enough to prevent internal CQ overruns for
  non-scalable communication patterns, but not so high as to waste
  provider-internal memory.
  See "GASNET_OFI_SET_UNIVERSE_SIZE" documentation for information on when
  this value is set automatically by ofi-conduit.  Most notably, ofi-conduit
  will not overwrite a value set by the user.

* FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_{SIZE,COUNT} - These libfabric variables control the cache
  of memory registrations used in some providers.  These settings are not
  directly consumed by GASNet ofi-conduit, but affect the behavior of some
  underlying providers it relies upon.
  When using a provider known to experience degraded RMA performance with the
  defaults, ofi-conduit may set these values to "-1" to remove all limits on
  the memory registration cache.
  See Bug 4676 under "Known problems" for information on when these variables
  are set by ofi-conduit.  Most notably, ofi-conduit will not overwrite a value
  set by the user.

* FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL - This variable only applies to the psm2 provider where
  it controls the internal locking state of the provider and can be set to the
  following three values:
    - FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL=0: All locks inside of the provider will be disabled.
    - FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL=1: Some locks inside of the provider will be disabled,
      and is suitable for programs that limit the access to each PSM2 context to
      a single thread.
    - FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL=2: All locks inside of the provider are enabled.
  The default setting of this variable is 2. The original author recommends using
  a value of 0 when using GASNet in GASNET_SEQ mode and a value of 1 when running
  in GASNET_PARSYNC mode. For GASNET_PAR mode, a value of 1 should only be used
  if GASNet was configured with --enable-ofi-thread-domain, which only will
  allow a single thread to make calls into libfabric at a time. Otherwise, the
  default value of 2 should be used. This variable should be used by power users
  only and should be used at your own risk.

* All the environment variables provided by libfabric (see `fi_info -e`)
  Note that many of these influence provider-specific behaviors, and in some
  cases setting non-default values may negatively affect the operation of
  ofi-conduit.

* The environment variables described in the "Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions" 
  section of this file.

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions
------------------------------------
For some calls to gex_RMA_Put{NB,NBI}() GASNet-EX requires the source buffer to be able to be reused as
soon as the function returns. The ofi-conduit implements this by a hybrid approach that uses
the FI_INJECT flag, bounce buffers, and blocking operations.

* If the nbytes parameter is less than or equal to the chosen provider's inject_size (see the 
  fi_endpoint(3) man page), the FI_INJECT flag will be used.
* If the nbytes parameter is greater than the inject size but less than or equal to a user specifiable
  threshold (default is 4 times the bounce buffer size) then bounce buffers will be used.
* If the nbytes parameter is greater than the threshold, the operation will be implemented as a 
  fully-blocking operation.

The following GASNet statistics counters show the number of times each of these code paths are entered:
NB_PUT_INJECT, NB_PUT_BOUNCE, NB_PUT_BLOCK.

The following environment variables may be used to tune this behavior:
* GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE - The size of each bounce buffer. Default is GASNET_PAGESIZE.
* GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS - The number of bounce buffers to be allocated at initialization. Default: 64
* GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD - Payload sizes above GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD will be transferred
  as a blocking operation. This is useful for when the overheads of bounce buffering become too great.
  Default: (4 * GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE).
* The following condition must hold: GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS >= GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD/GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE
* These defaults are chosen to optimize for a 256K L2 cache, assuming 4K pages. It is recommended to 
  modify these variables so that GASNET_PAGESIZE * GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS == L2-cache-size.
* These parameters only apply to gex_RMA_Put{NB,NBI}() with (lc_opt != GEX_EVENT_DEFER).
  They do not apply to gets, nor to blocking or value-based puts.

Known problems:
---------------

* Bug 4267
  Multi-threaded applications in which one or more threads are using GASNet
  concurrent with another thread calling gasnet_exit() may experience "random
  crashes" as the exiting thread destroys resources in use by the others.
  This includes otherwise benign calls to gasnet_AMPoll().

* Bug 4422
  By default, multi-threaded applications run on a single core when using psm2
  provider (for Omni-Path networks).  There are two known work-arounds
  available:
  + The undesired pinning to a single core will not take place if the process
    is already pinned to a strict subset of the host's CPU cores.  In many
    cases there are other motivations (such as NUMA affinity) for such pinning,
    making this our preferred recommendation when practical.  However, the best
    means to accomplish this may depend on the batch system.  An approach using
    hwloc-bind (independent of batch system) is demonstrated in the bug report
    (see link below).
  + If pinning to a strict subset of the host's CPU cores is either undesirable
    or impractical, one may instead set HFI_NO_CPUAFFINITY=1 in the environment
    to disable the undesired single-core pinning behavior.

* Bug 4461
  Under certain AM traffic patterns, the cxi provider (for the Slingshot-11
  network on some HPE Cray EX systems) has been observed to fail in various
  ways, including crashes and dropped messages.
  At the time of this writing, we recommend updating the Slingshot Host
  Software to version 2.1.0 or newer.  If that is not possible, an alternative
  work-around is to set
    GASNET_OFI_RECEIVE_BUFF_SIZE=recv
  in your environment.
  Empirical evidence shows both alternatives will prevent crashes in
  applications which exhibit them (which is *not* every application).  However,
  the possibility of application hangs due to dropped messages remains.
  Note that the environment setting disables use of the "multi-receive" feature
  of libfabric, and the default for GASNET_OFI_NUM_RECEIVE_BUFFS is adjusted to
  compensate.  This measurably increases the latency of small AM operations.
  So, it should only be used with older Slingshot releases and only if it is
  suspected that bug 4461 is impacting your application.

* Bug 4517
  In libfabric 1.11 and earlier, the verbs;ofi_rxm provider used on the
  Slingshot-10 network of some HPE Cray EX systems has been observed to
  experience corruption of AMs, which (at least sometimes) are diagnosed
  with a fatal error message like one of the following:
    GASNet node [...] received an AM message from node [...] for a handler
    index with no associated AM handler function registered
  OR
    *** FATAL ERROR: Assertion failure (proc 0): in gasnetc_ofi_handle_am()
    at [...]/ofi-conduit/gasnet_ofi.c:1341: isreq == header->isreq
       op1 :           1 (0x00000001) == isreq
       op2 :           0 (0x00000000) == header->isreq
  At the time of this writing, the best known work-around is to update
  libfabric to version 1.12 or newer.  However, replacing the vendor's
  version on a system like the HPE Cray EX is generally not advisable.
  So, for such systems an alternative work-around is to set
    GASNET_OFI_RECEIVE_BUFF_SIZE=recv
  in your environment.  This setting disables ofi-conduit's use of libfabric's
  "multi-receive" feature, and adjusts the default value for
  GASNET_OFI_NUM_RECEIVE_BUFFS to some unspecified larger value to compensate.
  Empirical evidence shows this prevents the failures in applications which
  exhibit them (which is *not* every application).  However, this measurably
  increases the latency of small AM operations.  So, this should only be used
  if it is suspected that bug 4517 is impacting your application.
  NOTE: On networks other than Slingshot-10, ofi-conduit enforces a minimum
  libfabric version of 1.12 for this provider and this bug should not arise.

* Bug 4554
  On an HPE Cray EX system with Nvidia GPUs, Slingshot-11 network, and the 2.0.0
  release of the Slingshot host software, it has been observed that tests using
  `GEX_MK_CLASS_CUDA_UVA` would crash in RMA Put operations of 224 bytes or
  less.  An example backtrace would include something like the following, where
  the "cuda_gdrcopy_*" frames are the key ones:
    [3] #7  <signal handler called>
    [3] #8  cuda_gdrcopy_impl (handle=0, devptr=0x148e53200000, hostptr=0x17d27f0, len=4, dir=dir@entry=GDRCOPY_FROM_DEVICE) at src/hmem_cuda_gdrcopy.c:265
    [3] #9  0x0000148e9e82e9c4 in cuda_gdrcopy_from_dev (handle=<optimized out>, hostptr=<optimized out>, devptr=<optimized out>, len=<optimized out>) at src/hmem_cuda_gdrcopy.c:291
    [3] #10 0x0000148e9e82d5dd in cuda_copy_from_dev (device=<optimized out>, dst=<optimized out>, src=<optimized out>, size=<optimized out>) at src/hmem_cuda.c:176
    [3] #11 0x0000148e9e82c1ed in ofi_copy_from_hmem (size=4, src=<optimized out>,
  If one experiences crashes similar to the backtrace above with NVIDIA GPUs and
  the Slingshot-11 network, check if the command `rpm -qa libfabric` reports a
  version containing "SSHOT2.0.0".  If it does, then this bug is present and the
  only known work-around for a user is to set `FI_HMEM_CUDA_USE_GDRCOPY=no` in
  one's environment.
  We also recommend asking your system administrator to upgrade to Slingshot
  2.0.1 or newer.

* Bug 4565
  Use of explicit --with-ofi-provider=generic with the Cray Aries network (gni
  provider) selects a memory registration mode for which the provider claims
  support, but which does not work in practice.
  There are currently two known work-arounds at configure time:
  + The following overrides the dynamic selection of memory registration mode:
      --with-ofi-provider=generic --enable-ofi-virt-addr --enable-ofi-mr-prov-key
    The resulting GASNet will only work with the gni and verbs providers,
    despite otherwise preserving use of the generic provider.
  + The following specializes for gni, disabling dynamic feature detection:
      --with-ofi-provider=gni
    The resulting GASNet will only work with gni provider.

* Bug 4581
  Currently, ofi-conduit's implementation of `gasnet_getMaxLocalSegmentSize()`
  does not take into consideration any limits a given provider may impose on the
  maximum length of a memory registration.  This may result in warnings like the
  following (often followed by a fatal error in the client):
      *** WARNING (proc 0): Unexpected error -12 (Cannot allocate memory) from
          fi_mr_regattr() when binding segment [0x.., 0x...) to EP 0
  The only known work-around at this time is to allocate a smaller segment.

* Bug 4652
  There exist versions and/or configurations of Slurm on HPE Cray EX systems
  which prevent the launch of single-node ofi-conduit jobs with the cxi
  provider.  Failure messages (one per-process) look like the following:
    *** FATAL ERROR (proc 0): in gasnetc_ofi_init() at
    [...]/gasnet_ofi.c:1164: fi_domain failed: -38(Function not implemented)
  For certain versions/configurations, one can work around this issue either
  by adding `--network=single_node_vni` to one's `srun` command or by setting
  `SLURM_NETWORK=single_node_vni` in the environment.  However, there are
  also versions/configurations for which there is no known work-around.

* Bug 4676
  It is known that the default values of the FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_COUNT and
  FI_MR_CACHE_MAX_SIZE environment variables can adversely impact RMA
  performance when using the cxi or verbs providers.  Therefore, by default
  when configured to use either of these two providers (or the "generic"
  provider with FI_PROVIDER set to "cxi" or "verbs") ofi-conduit will set these
  variables to "-1" in order to remove the limits on the memory registration
  cache.  However, the conduit will never overwrite a user-provided setting.
  To request the libfabric default values for either variable, one may set
  them to an empty string, which instructs ofi-conduit to unset the variable.
  Note that if libfabric is initialized prior to ofi-conduit, such as by an
  libfabric-based MPI used for job launch, then neither the automatic behavior
  nor the use of an empty string to suppress it will occur early enough to
  have the desired effect.  In such cases, it is recommended to set these two
  environment variables to "-1" manually (to remove the limits) or to leave them
  unset (to use libfabric's default values).

* CXI provider and large procs-per-node (includes bugs 4478 and 4480)
  There have been observations of multiple failure modes early in startup when
  using the "cxi" provider with 128 or more processes per node.  These include
  fatal errors (see bug 4480) and in some cases hangs (see bug 4478).

* Bug 4750
  GASNet supports RMA and AM Long to/from any valid local address, including
  addresses within the segment of a shared-memory peer when cross-mapped via
  PSHM. However, it has been observed that with the cxi provider on an HPE
  Cray EX system, such cross-mapped accesses do not work together with PSHM
  over XPMEM (not the default).  While not observed directly, we suspect that
  other providers which register memory with the NIC (e.g. verbs) may also
  fail when using PSHM over XPMEM.

* See docs/memory_kinds_implementation.md in the GASNet-EX sources for current
  information regarding known issues with respect to memory kinds support in
  ofi-conduit.

  https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/

* Limits to MPI interoperability (includes bugs 4455 and 4638)
  Depending on the libfabric provider in use, it may not be possible to have both
  MPI and GASNet using the native network API in the same application.  There
  are known issues with the psm2 and cxi providers, though the latter's issue
  also represents a general concern.

  The psm2 provider has the property that each process may only open
  the network adapter once.  If you wish to use MPI and GASNet in the same
  application on the Omni-Path (OPA) fabric, then there are two options:
    1. GASNet may be configured to use an alternative transport.
       Options include mpi- and udp-conduits.
    2. MPI may be configured to use an alternative transport (most likely TCP).
  The relative performance implications of these options depends strongly on the
  properties of each application.

  The cxi provider requires use of `FI_` environment variables to configure
  the provider to reliably handle Active Messages under heavy loads.  It has
  been observed that HPE Cray MPI uses some of the same settings, but with
  values which differ from ofi-conduit's validated values.  As a result,
  initializing MPI prior to GASNet *might* yield less reliable Active Messages
  and possible hangs or crashes.  Therefore, by default, when an ofi-conduit
  application is launched using `srun`, care is taken to avoid initializing MPI
  as the spawner.  This is the recommended practice for applications which do
  not also use MPI.
  The most up-to-date information on this issue is maintained at:
    https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4455

  While there is a conflict between the cxi provider settings preferred by HPE
  Cray MPICH and GASNet-EX's ofi-conduit, it *is* possible to run hybrid
  applications which use both.  However, if GASNet-EX is initialized before MPI,
  one may see failures of MPI_init() with messages including text like the
  following:
    create_endpoint(1311).......: OFI EP enable failed (ofi_init.c:1311:create_endpoint:Address already in use)
  This can be resolved by ensuring that MPI initializes first.  That can be
  accomplished either explicitly in the application source code, or implicitly
  by setting `GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER=mpi` in the environment at application run
  time.  Unfortunately, that will lead to lengthy warnings which begin with the
  following text:
    *** WARNING: ofi-conduit failed to configure FI_CXI_* environment variables due to prior conflicting settings.
  The warning message ends with text directing the reader here.
  The most up-to-date information on this issue, including recommendations
  regarding the "conflicting settings" warning, is maintained at:
    https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4638

  With the gni provider, when Cray MPI is initialized prior to GASNet (including
  via use of MPI for job launch), a fatal error is seen at startup which
  includes the following text:
    fi_domain failed: -16(Device or resource busy)
  Meanwhile, hybrid applications which initialize GASNet before MPI have been
  observed to run correctly.  Therefore, the following recommendations apply to
  gni provider:
    + Do not use MPI for job launch:
      Configure using `--with-ofi-spawner=pmi --with-pmi-version=cray` to
      ensure the `gasnetrun_ofi` script defaults to use of PMI-based job
      spawning, and that configure will fail if the necessary Cray PMI library
      cannot be located.  This latter point is important even if one is not
      using the `gasnetrun_ofi` script.
    + Hybrid applications should initialize GASNet before MPI.

  As noted above, the specific issue with the cxi provider also represents a
  more general concern that an MPI implementation may configure libfabric in
  a way which is incompatible with GASNet's ofi-conduit OR that GASNet's
  settings could cause problems for the MPI implementation.  However, there are
  currently no known cases of either such interaction other than with the cxi
  and gni providers as described above.

Future work:
------------

The OFI community is working on increasing the number of providers that can support GASNet.

* Implement AMLong via target-side reassembly using fi_writedata()

* Implement asynchronous LC support for Long, most likely as part of the
  work to implement target-side reassembly.

* Improve non-trivial support for `GEX_FLAG_IMMEDIATE` with AM Long, once
  target-side reassembly removes the "sync" of "put-sync-send".

* Improve asynchronous LC support for Put.  Like libibverbs, libfabric
  does not provide distinct events for local versus remote completion.
  Therefore, the current support for `GEX_EVENT_{DEFER,GROUP}` signals local
  completion immediately before remote/operation completion. However, use of
  `FI_INJECT` could be used to achieve synchronous completion of small Puts
  in the same manner that ibv-conduit utilizes inline sends.

* Extend native support for Negotiated-Payload Active Message (NPAM) Medium
  to enable xfers larger than Max Medium.

* Implement native support for Negotiated-Payload Active Message (NPAM) Long?

* Eliminate a buffer copy for AM Medium (and AM Long below the RMA threshold)
  by using (iov_count > 1) on providers which support it, along with the
  corresponding asynchronous LC support for AM Medium.

* Implement native atomics via FI_ATOMIC

* Implement native collectives via FI_COLLECTIVE

* Seek a better barrier than RDMADISSEM via FI_COLLECTIVE
