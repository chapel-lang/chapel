This is the README for ofi-conduit.

OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection
of libraries and applications used to export fabric services.

@ Section: Building @

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. To use ofi-conduit, the user needs first
install libfabric. The source code of libfabric can be found at:
https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric

To build GASNet with ofi-conduit enabled:
./configure --prefix=[Build Path] --enable-ofi --with-ofihome=[custom libfabric install directory]

To set job launcher, add --with-ofispawner=[ssh or mpi or pmi].
When using PMI as job launcher, the user can further add
--with-spawnerroot=[custom job launcher directory] 
to specify which job launcher to use.

At runtime the environment variable GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER (set to "mpi" or "ssh")
can override the value set at configuration time, but the command line option
will override the environment variable.
