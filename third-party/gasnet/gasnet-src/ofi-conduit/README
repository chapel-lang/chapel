User Information:
----------------
This is the README for ofi-conduit.

OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection of
libraries and applications used to export fabric services. 

See more details at: http://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

The GASNet OFI conduit can run on any OFI provider that supports its
requirements. At this point in time, it is known to work on the following
providers (using the provider names in parenthesis):
  + Sockets (sockets)
  + Intel(R) Omni-Path Fabric (psm2)
  + TCP, via "tcp;ofi_rxm", under libfabric 1.7 and higher (tcp)
  + Verbs, via "verbs;ofi_rxm", under libfabric 1.7 and higher (verbs)

Work has been done to enable the gni provider which runs on Cray XC(TM)
systems. The author of this conduit has seen good results from the preliminary
testing of this provider, however has not had enough time to thoroughly
validate it. As such, the gni provider should be considered experimental.

The fi_info command installed with libfabric can be used to query the available
OFI providers.

While OFI conduit can be considered as a tech-preview for next-generation fabrics,
it is the recommended conduit for use on the Intel Omni-Path fabric.

Users with InfiniBand hardware should use the GASNet ibv-conduit, rather than
ofi-conduit with the verbs OFI provider, as the former may provide better performance.

Users with Ethernet hardware are encouraged to consider the GASNet udp-conduit as an alternative
to ofi-conduit with the sockets provider, as the former may provide more favorable performance.

Users with Cray XC hardware are encouraged to consider the GASNet aries-conduit
as an alternative to ofi-conduit with the GNI provider, as the former may provide better performance.

The psm1 provider (for the end-of-life TrueScale product) is no longer supported.

OFI provider requirements to run this conduit:
-------------------------------------
Endpoint type: RDM
Capabilities: FI_RMA and FI_MSG
Secondary Capabilities: FI_MULTI_RECV
Memory Registration Mode: FI_MR_SCALABLE (preferred) or FI_MR_BASIC
    * There is currently no support for providers that require FI_LOCAL_MR
Threading mode: FI_THREAD_SAFE and/or FI_THREAD_DOMAIN
    * In GASNET_{SEQ,PARSYNC} mode, all providers use FI_THREAD_DOMAIN as only one thread makes
      calls into the GASNet library.
    * In GASNET_PAR mode, FI_THREAD_DOMAIN is used only for the psm2 provider which currently
      does not support FI_THREAD_SAFE. All other providers use FI_THREAD_SAFE.

Building ofi-conduit
--------------------

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. To use ofi-conduit, the user firsts needs to 
locate or build an install of libfabric. The source code of libfabric can be found at:

   https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric

To build GASNet with ofi-conduit enabled:
./configure --enable-ofi --with-ofihome=[custom libfabric install directory]

ofi-conduit exposes the following configure script flags for GASNet:
    * --with-ofi-provider=PROVIDER_NAME: As different providers expose different feature sets,
      this flags exists to specify a provider to assume for compile-time optimization. If this
      flag is not present, the configure script will attempt to detect an available
      provider using the fi_info utility, if available. If fi_info is not available, a
      supported provider not available, or if the argument to this flag is "default",
      then provider features will be detected at runtime. While this is flexible as to
      which providers it supports, it will also add branches in critical paths that 
      may increase software overheads.
    * --with-ofi-num-completions=VALUE: Specifies the maximum number of
      transmit completions to be read from the transmit CQ during each call to the
      polling function. Default: 64
    * --with-ofi-max-medium=VALUE: Specify the maximum size of AMMedium messages in
      ofi-conduit. This may be useful for tuning the conduit to different network
      hardware. Default: 8192

The following configure flags override options set by provider selection via
auto-detection or by the --with-ofi-provider=VALUE flag. These are not recommended to be
used as tuning options.
    * --enable-ofi-thread-domain: In GASNET_PAR mode, forces the use of FI_THREAD_DOMAIN in the conduit.
      This results in the use of one global lock to protect calls into libfabric. In GASNET_{SEQ,PARSYNC}
      mode, this flag has no effect.
    * --disable-ofi-thread-domain: In GASNET_PAR mode, forces the use of FI_THREAD_SAFE in the conduit.
      In GASNET_{SEQ,PARSYNC} mode, this flag has no effect.
        ** Currently, only the psm2 provider requires the use of
           FI_THREAD_DOMAIN in this conduit. These flags exists to future-proof this
           version of ofi-conduit against future support for FI_THREAD_SAFE for these
           providers.
    * --enable-ofi-mr-scalable: Indicates that FI_MR_SCALABLE memory registration support will be 
      statically compiled into the conduit. This is the default (and recommended) option for the 
      psm2 and sockets provider.
    * --disable-ofi-mr-scalable: Indicates that FI_MR_BASIC memory registration support
      will be statically compiled into the conduit. This is the default option for the
      gni provider, which at this time does not support FI_MR_SCALABLE.

The default spawner to be used by the gasnetrun_ofi utility can be
selected by configuring '--with-ofi-spawner=VALUE', where VALUE is one
of 'mpi', 'pmi' or 'ssh'.  If this option is not used, mpi is the
default when available, and ssh otherwise.
Here are some things to consider when selecting a default spawner:
  + mpi-spawner is the default when MPI is available precisely because it
    is so frequently present on systems where GASNet is to be installed.
    Additionally, very little (if any) configuration is required and the
    behavior is highly reliable.
  + pmi-spawner uses the same "Process Management Interface" which forms
    the basis for many mpirun implementations.  When support is available,
    this spawner can be as easy to use and as reliable as mpi-spawner, but
    without the overheads of initializing an MPI runtime.
  + ssh-spawner depends only on the availability of a remote shell command
    such as ssh.  For this reason ssh-spawner support is always compiled.
    However, it can be difficult (or impossible) to use on a cluster which
    was not setup to allow ssh to (and among) its compute nodes.
For more information on configuration and use of these spawners, see
   README-{ssh,mpi,pmi}-spawner (installed)
or
   other/{ssh,mpi,pmi}-spawner/README (source).

Depending on the libfabric provider in use, there may be restrictions on how
mpi-based spawning is used.  In particular, the psm2 provider has the
property that each process may only open the network adapter once.  If you
wish to use mpi-spawner, please consult its README for advice on how to set
your MPIRUN_CMD to use TCP/IP.

Job Spawning
------------

If using UPC, Titanium, etc. the language-specific commands should be used
to launch applications.  Otherwise, applications can be launched using
the gasnetrun_ofi utility:
  + usage summary:
    gasnetrun_ofi -n <n> [options] [--] prog [program args]
    options:
      -n <n>                 number of processes to run (required)
      -N <N>                 number of nodes to run on (not supported by all MPIs)
      -E <VAR1[,VAR2...]>    list of environment vars to propagate
      -v                     be verbose about what is happening
      -t                     test only, don't execute anything (implies -v)
      -k                     keep any temporary files created (implies -v)
      -spawner=(ssh|mpi|pmi) force use of a specific spawner (if available)

There are as many as three possible methods (ssh, mpi and pmi) by which one
can launch an ofi-conduit application.  Ssh-based spawning is always
available, and mpi- and pmi-based spawning are available if the respective
support was located at configure time.  The default is established at
configure time (see section "Building ofi-conduit", above).

To select a non-default spawner one may either use the "-spawner=" command-
line argument or set the environment variable GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER to "ssh",
"mpi" or "pmi".  If both are used, then the command line argument takes
precedence.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER
  To override the default spawner for ofi-conduit jobs, one may set this
  environment variable as described in the section "Job Spawning", above.
  There are additional settings which control behaviors of the various
  spawners, as described in the respective READMEs (listed in section
  "Building ofi-conduit", above).

* GASNET_QUIET - set to 1 to silence the startup warning indicating
  the provider in use may deliver suboptimal performance.

* GASNET_OFI_RMA_POLL_FREQ - In order to ensure efficient progress, the conduit polls the RMA
  transmit completion queue once for every GASNET_OFI_RMA_POLL_FREQ RMA injections. Default: 32

* GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS, GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE, GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD - See the
  "Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions" section for detail on these environment variables.

* FI_PROVIDER - set to a provider name to override the default OFI provider selection

* FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL - This variable only applies to the psm2 provider and only
  is available in libfabric v1.5.0. This environment variable controls the
  internal locking state of the provider and can be set to the following three
  values:
    - FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL=0: All locks inside of the provider will be disabled.
    - FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL=1: Some locks inside of the provider will be disabled,
      and is suitable for programs that limit the access to each PSM2 context to
      a single thread.
    - FI_PSM2_LOCK_LEVEL=2: All locks inside of the provider are enabled.
  The default setting of this variable is 2. The conduit author recommends using
  a value of 0 when using GASNet in GASNET_SEQ mode and a value of 1 when running
  in GASNET_PARSYNC mode. For GASNET_PAR mode, a value of 1 should only be used
  if GASNet was configured with --enable-ofi-thread-domain, which only will
  allow a single thread to make calls into libfabric at a time. Otherwise, the
  default value of 2 should be used. This variable should be used by power users
  only and should be used at your own risk.

* All the environment variables provided by libfabric (see `fi_info -e`)

* The environment variables described in the "Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions" 
  section of this file.

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Non-bulk, Non-blocking Put Functions
------------------------------------
GASNet requires the source buffer used in the gasnet_put_{nb,nbi} functions to be able to be reused as
soon as the function returns. The ofi-conduit implements this by a hybrid approach that uses
the FI_INJECT flag, bounce buffers, and blocking operations.

* If the nbytes parameter is less than or equal to the chosen provider's inject_size (see the 
  fi_endpoint(3) man page), the FI_INJECT flag will be used.
* If the nbytes parameter is greater than the inject size but less than or equal to a user specifiable
  threshold (default is 4 times the bounce buffer size) then bounce buffers will be used.
* If the nbytes parameter is greater than the threshold, the operation will be implemented as a 
  fully-blocking operation.

The following GASNet statistics counters show the number of times each of these code paths are entered:
NB_PUT_INJECT, NB_PUT_BOUNCE, NB_PUT_BLOCK.

The following environment variables may be used to tune this behavior:
* GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE - The size of each bounce buffer. Default is GASNET_PAGESIZE.
* GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS - The number of bounce buffers to be allocated at initialization. Default: 64
* GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD - Payload sizes above GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD will be transferred
  as a blocking operation. This is useful for when the overheads of bounce buffering become too great.
  Default: (4 * GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE).
* The following condition must hold: GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS >= GASNET_OFI_BBUF_THRESHOLD/GASNET_OFI_BBUF_SIZE
* These defaults are chosen to optimize for a 256K L2 cache, assuming 4K pages. It is recommended to 
  modify these variables so that GASNET_PAGESIZE * GASNET_OFI_NUM_BBUFS == L2-cache-size. However,
  these tuning parameters only apply to gasnet_put_{nb,nbi}(). They do not apply to get functions, blocking
  functions, or bulk put functions.

Known problems:
---------------
* The following bugs are present in libfabric v1.5.0 and will be addressed in a
  future libfabric release. Until then, patches to correct these issues are
  listed with the below descriptions.
  - sockets provider hang
        * Under atypical conditions of heavy active messaging flood traffic, the
          sockets provider will occasionally hang.
        * This bug was also present in libfabric v1.4.0
        * This has been fixed in upstream libfabric. The patch that corrects
          this behavior can be found in the link below.
        * LBNL Bugzilla link: https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3597
        * libfabric GitHub issue link: https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/issues/3217
        * Patch that fixes the bug: https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/pull/3223
    - gni provider segfault
        * When using FI_MULTI_RECV (as the ofi-conduit does), the gni provider may segfault.
        * This bug has been fixed in upstream libfabric.
        * Patch that fixes the bug: https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/pull/3208

* See the GASNet Bugzilla server for details on additional known bugs:
  https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/

* Limits to MPI interoperability
  Depending on the libfabric provider in use, it may not be possible to have both
  MPI and GASNet using the native network API in the same application.  In
  particular, the psm2 provider has the property that each process may only open
  the network adapter once.  If you wish to use MPI and GASNet in the same
  application on the Intel Omni-Path fabric, then there are two options:
    1. GASNet may be configured to use an alternative transport.
       Options include mpi- and udp-conduits.
    2. MPI may be configured to use an alternative transport (most likely TCP).
  The relative performance implications of these options depends strongly on the
  properties of each application.


Future work:
------------

The OFI community is working on increasing the number of providers that can support GASNet.
