GASNet ofi-conduit documentation

User Information:
----------------
This is the README for ofi-conduit.

OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is a framework focused on exporting fabric
communication services to applications. OFI is best described as a collection
of libraries and applications used to export fabric services. 

See more details at: http://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

The GASNet OFI conduit can run on any OFI provider that supports its requirements. At this
point in time, it is known to work on the Sockets provider, Intel Truescale provider (psm),
and Intel Omni-Path provider (psm2).  The fi_info command installed with libfabrics can be 
used to query the available OFI providers.

The OFI conduit can be considered as a tech-preview for next generation fabrics. We are
in the process of tuning its performance on Intel Omni-Path fabric. If you are looking to
obtain the best performance on Intel Omni-Path fabric, please continue to use the PSM
conduit until we complete our performance optimizations. 

Users with InfiniBand harware should use the GASNet ibv-conduit, as the verbs OFI provider 
does not yet implement all the capabilities needed by ofi-conduit.

Users with Ethernet hardware are encouraged to consider the GASNet udp-conduit as an alternative
to ofi-conduit with the sockets provider, as the former may provide more favorable performance.

Building ofi-conduit
--------------------

Libfabric is a core component of OFI. To use ofi-conduit, the user firsts needs to 
locate or build an install of libfabric. The source code of libfabric can be found at:

   https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric

To build GASNet with ofi-conduit enabled:
./configure --prefix=[Build Path] --enable-ofi --with-ofihome=[custom libfabric install directory]

To set job launcher, add --with-ofispawner=[ssh or mpi or pmi].
When using PMI as job launcher, the user can further add
--with-spawnerroot=[custom job launcher directory] 
to specify which job launcher to use.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER - set to "mpi", "ssh" or "pmi" to override the value set at
  configuration time. The gasnetrun_ofi -spawner option overrides the
  environment variable.

* GASNET_QUIET - set to 1 to silence the startup warning indicating
  the provider in use may deliver suboptimal performance.

* FI_PROVIDER - set to a provider name to override the default OFI provider selection

* All the environment variables provided by libfabric (see `fi_info -e`)

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.


Future work:
------------

The OFI community is working on increasing the number of providers that can support GASNet.
