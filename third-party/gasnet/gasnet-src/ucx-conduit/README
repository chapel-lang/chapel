User Information:
-----------------

Ucx-conduit implements GASNet over the Unified Communication X (UCX) framework.
See http://www.openucx.org/ for general information on UCX.

Currently, the ucx-conduit only includes the implementation of GASNet
Active Messages and should not be used for performance measurements.

Ucx-conduit is a work-in-progress and currently disabled by default.
If youâ€™re interested in trying it, please email gasnet-staff@lbl.gov for instructions.

Where this conduit runs:
-----------------------

This conduit is based on UCX HPC communication library.
UCX is the Unified Communication X (UCX) communication library
(http://www.openucx.org/).  This is an open-source project
developed in collaboration between industry, laboratories, and
academia to create an open-source production grade communication
framework for data centric and high-performance applications.  The
UCX library can be downloaded from repositories (e.g.,
Fedora/RedHat yum repositories). The UCX library is also part of
Mellanox OFED and Mellanox HPC-X binary distributions.

UCX currently supports:
- OpenFabrics Verbs (including InfiniBand and RoCE)
- Cray's uGNI
- TCP
- Shared memory
- NVIDIA CUDA drivers

It is recommended to use UCX conduit with Mellanox InfiniBand devices.

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Job spawning:
-------------

### Explain how to spawn jobs for your conduit, and any special concerns.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)
* UCX environment parameters
    - Most commonly used variables are described by the following link
      https://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/UCX-environment-parameters
    - See also the output of `ucx_info -f` for the full list of parameters
      supported by a particular UCX version.

Known problems:
---------------

* See the GASNet Bugzilla server for details on known bugs:
  https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/
* This version is known to have high memory consumption under certain workloads
  (i.e. high volume of Long AMs or one-sided puts)

Future work:
------------

The following features are planned of the next version of the UCX conduit:
* Address the high memory consumption issue (See the "Known problems" section).
* HW accelerated one-sided operations
* HW accelerated atomics operations
