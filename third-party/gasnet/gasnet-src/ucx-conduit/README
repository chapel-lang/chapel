@ Section: Overview @

  Ucx-conduit implements GASNet over the Unified Communication X (UCX) framework
  (see http://www.openucx.org/ for general information on UCX).
  
  This is the first version of the conduit is feature complete and supports 
  Active Messages and hardware-offloaded One-Sided and Atomic operaions.
  A performance assessment and fine-tuning is planned for the next release.

  As this is an initial version of the conduit, it is disabled by default.
  It can be enabled at GASNet configure time using the `--enable-ucx` option.

@ Section: Where this conduit runs @

  The conduit is based on Unified Communication X (UCX) communication library (see 
  http://www.openucx.org/ for general information on UCX). UCX is an open-source project
  developed in collaboration between industry, laboratories, and academia to create 
  an open-source production grade communication framework for data-centric and 
  high-performance applications.  The UCX library can be downloaded from repositories
  (e.g., Fedora/RedHat yum repositories). The UCX library is also part of Mellanox OFED 
  and Mellanox HPC-X binary distributions.

  The conduit is tested and known to work with
    - Mellanox InfiniBand devices starting from ConnectX-5, while UCX also supports 
      Mellanox RoCE devices, it wasn't yet experimentally confirmed to work with GASNet.
    - UCX library version 1.6 and above
    - Linux platform.
    
  For Mellanox adapters, UCX conduit supports all transports: RC, UD and DC. For large-scale
  applications, it is recommended to use DC transport for scalability reasons.

@ Section: Build-time Configuration @
  
  In order to enable the conduit, '--with-ucx[=<path-to-ucx>]' parameter needs to be specified.
  By default, ucx-conduit will not be built. Currently, the conduit does not provide any other
  configuration-time parameters. 
  See the extended-ref README for the GASNet general-purpose configuration parameters.

@ Section: Job Spawning @

If using UPC, Titanium, etc. the language-specific commands should be used
to launch applications.  Otherwise, applications can be launched using
the gasnetrun_ucx utility:
+ usage summary:
gasnetrun_ucx -n <n> [options] [--] prog [program args]
options:
  -n <n>                 number of processes to run (required)
  -N <N>                 number of nodes to run on (not supported by all MPIs)
  -E <VAR1[,VAR2...]>    list of environment vars to propagate
  -v                     be verbose about what is happening
  -t                     test only, don't execute anything (implies -v)
  -k                     keep any temporary files created (implies -v)
  -spawner=(ssh|mpi|pmi) force use of a specific spawner (if available)

There are as many as three possible methods (ssh, mpi and pmi) by which one
can launch an ucx-conduit application.  Ssh-based spawning is always
available, and mpi- and pmi-based spawning are available if the respective
support was located at configure time.  The default is established at
configure time (see section "Build-time Configuration").

To select a non-default spawner one may either use the "-spawner=" command-
line argument or set the environment variable GASNET_UCX_SPAWNER to "ssh",
"mpi" or "pmi".  If both are used, then the command line argument takes
precedence.

@ Section: Runtime Configuration @

  In order to control UCX parameters (i.e. device or transport selection), environment
  variables are used. 
  
  Most commonly used variables are described on the UCX Wiki page
  https://github.com/openucx/ucx/wiki/UCX-environment-parameters
  
  For the full list of tuning knobs supported by a particular UCX version,
  see the output of `ucx_info -f`.
  
  For software stacks allowing concurrent use of UCX library in its different components
  or layers, UCX conduit supports personalized prefix "UCX_GASNET" (i.e. "UCX_GASNET_TLS", 
  "UCX_GASNET_NET_DEVICES") that allows specifying unique parameters for the 
  ucx-conduit that will not affect or conflict with global parameters (i.e. "UCX_TLS", 
  "UCX_NET_DEVICES") and/or other personalized parameters.
  
  "UCX_TLS" environment variable controls transport selection and is one of the most commonly
  used UCX parameters. Available options are:

    $ ucx_info -f | grep UCX_TLS -B 23 | head -n 20
      #
      # Comma-separated list of transports to use. The order is not meaningful.
      #  - all     : use all the available transports.
      #  - sm/shm  : all shared memory transports (mm, cma, knem).
      #  - mm      : shared memory transports - only memory mappers.
      #  - ugni    : ugni_smsg and ugni_rdma (uses ugni_udt for bootstrap).
      #  - ib      : all infiniband transports (rc/rc_mlx5, ud/ud_mlx5, dc_mlx5).
      #  - rc_v    : rc verbs (uses ud for bootstrap).
      #  - rc_x    : rc with accelerated verbs (uses ud_mlx5 for bootstrap).
      #  - rc      : rc_v and rc_x (preferably if available).
      #  - ud_v    : ud verbs.
      #  - ud_x    : ud with accelerated verbs.
      #  - ud      : ud_v and ud_x (preferably if available).
      #  - dc/dc_x : dc with accelerated verbs.
      #  - tcp     : sockets over TCP/IP.
      #  - cuda    : CUDA (NVIDIA GPU) memory support.
      #  - rocm    : ROCm (AMD GPU) memory support.
      #  Using a \ prefix before a transport name treats it as an explicit transport name
      #  and disables aliasing.
      # 

  In order to make sure that ucx-conduit is being used with Mellanox devices, the following
  transport set is recommended: "UCX_GASNET_TLS=ib,sm,self".

  Ucx-conduit supports all of the standard and the optional GASNET_EXITTIMEOUT GASNet
  environment variables. See GASNet's top-level README for documentation.

@ Section: Multi-rail Support @

  While UCX supports multi-rail configurations, the conduit wasn't tested in this mode
  and currently considered as not-supporting this feature.

@ Section: On-Demand Paging (ODP) Support @

  The conduit supports ODP through UCX, see "UCX_IB_REG_METHODS" UCX environemtn variable.

@ Section: HCA Configuration @

  Consult corresponding section in ibv-conduit README file.
  TODO: Check if UCX provides any aditional/conflicting advices.

@ Section: Known Problems @

  + See the GASNet Bugzilla server for details on known bugs:
    https://gasnet-bugs.lbl.gov/
  + This version is known to have issues with Mellanox ConnectX-4 adapters

@ Section: Design Overview @

  The UCX conduit implements GASNet core and extended API for UCX-compatible
  network adapters. Where:
  (a) Core API includes conduit resource initialization and cleanup functionality
  along with Active Message communication;
  (b) Extended API includes one-sided and atomic operations support.

  References:
  + UCX API documentation:
    http://openucx.github.io/ucx/api/v1.6/html/index.html

  Resource allocation and initialization:
    During GASNet initialization, every process creates a UCX worker, participates
    in the exchange of worker addresses (with Allgather communication pattern), and
    creates UCP endpoints representing connections to all other processes in the
    GASNet job. In addition, a set of service buffers for Active Messages is
    allocated and all required UCP memory registrations and memory key exchanges
    are performed.

  Active Message:
    UCX conduit implementation is using a pool of pre-allocated AM header buffers
    that are used for all types of AMs.
    For Medium size messages, for both sends and recvs, the payload is transferred
    through the bounce buffers to reduce the latency in absence of local completion
    options ("lc_opt") support. This behavior will be reconsidered in future.
    For Large AMs payload transfer is implemented using RDMA Put operation.

  RDMA/AMO:
    Implementation of RDMA Put and Atomic operations is a thin layer on top of UCP
    primitives. In addition, "ucp_ep_flush_nb" is used to implement remote completion
    tracking for single-rail configurations. Currently, UCX conduit doesn't support
    multi-rail configurations.

    UCX directly supports a fixed set of atomic operations, unsupported operations
    are handled by generic GASNet implementation. The status of atomic operation
    support is described in the table below:

                I32/U32/I64/U64
    ---         ---------------
    SET:        Y
    GET:        Y
    SWAP:       Y
    (F)CAS:     Y
    (F)ADD:     Y
    (F)SUB:     Y
    (F)INC:     Y
    (F)DEC:     Y
    (F)MULT:    N
    (F)MIN:     N
    (F)MAX:     N
    (F)AND:     Y
    (F)OR:      Y
    (F)XOR:     Y

    Y = offload is supported
    N = offload is not supported

@ Section: Graceful exits @

  Graceful exits are supported by the conduit. The design is based
  on ib-conduit description (see ib-conduit README).
  The main difference from ibv-conduit design is an "election" procedure
  in case global exit experienced timeout.
  In ibv-conduit, rank 0 is used to arbitrate between other ranks in 
  competition for "master" role.
  In ucx-conduit, rank 0 is always considered to be "master". It takes this
  role when it receives the request to perform exit from other ranks.
  There might be a further improvement of the non-global exit protocol by
  sequentially trying ranks 1, 2, ..., <myself> if rank 0 failed to confirm
  it has taken "master" role (noted in the Further work section).

@ Section: Future work @

  + Implement support for local completion options ("lc_opt").
  + Additional round of performance analysis and tuning.
  + Investigate older UCX versions and hardware compatibility and update README.
  + Support Graceful exits if rank 0 has failed.
