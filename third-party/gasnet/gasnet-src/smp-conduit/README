GASNet smp-conduit documentation
Dan Bonachea <bonachea@cs.berkeley.edu>

User Information:
-----------------

smp-conduit provides a single-node loopback GASNet implementation for 
smp or uniprocessor systems lacking network hardware or API's.
It should be extremely portable and run anywhere with a POSIX-like environment.

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------

* GASNET_BARRIER=PSHM (default when PSHM support is enabled)
  Enables shared-memory implementation of GASNet barriers

* All the standard GASNet environment variables (see top-level README)

Optional compile-time settings:
------------------------------

* All the compile-time settings from extended-ref (see the extended-ref README)

Known problems:
---------------

* See the Berkeley UPC Bugzilla server for details on known bugs.

Future work:
------------

===============================================================================

Design Overview:
----------------

All puts/gets are local accesses (with the locality check removed at compile
time).  When PSHM is not in use all AM handlers execute synchronously on the
calling thread, and segment alignment is trivially guaranteed.
