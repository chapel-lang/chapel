GASNet-EX ChangeLog
-------------------

  GASNet-EX is a work-in-progress.
  Many features remain to be specified, implemented, and/or tuned.

  Feedback or questions on any matters related to the EX project are
  welcomed at: gasnet-devel@lbl.gov

  GASNet-EX currently implements the following conduits:
  - InfiniBand Verbs (ibv-conduit)
  - Cray uGNI (aries-conduits)
  - IBM PAMI (pami-conduit) *DEPRECATED*
  - Shared-memory (smp-conduit)
  - Portable UDP (udp-conduit)
  - Portable MPI (mpi-conduit)
  Users wishing to use other conduits are recommended to download the GASNet v1.x
  distribution from https://gasnet.lbl.gov.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

  - Rename gex_NbrhdInfo_t to gex_RankInfo_t
  - New GEX_FLAG_USES_GASNET1 flag enables gex_Client_Init() for legacy GASNet-1 calls
  - Minor clarifications throughout
  - Consult docs/GASNet-EX.txt for the detailed status of the evolving specification
     
* Major new features implemented in this release:
  - Teams:
    + Full multi-team support across the entire specification, including
      construction of subset teams and rank reordering via gex_TM_Split()
    + Can translate in either direction between team-relative and job ranks
    + All APIs taking (tm,rank) pairs interpret 'rank' relative to 'tm'
  - Collectives:
    + Non-blocking Barrier, Broadcast, and ReduceToOne
   Additional collective operations will be added in future releases
  - Non-contiguous RMA: Vector, Indexed, Strided (VIS)
    + VIS Puts now support notifying (potentially remote) peers of completion.
      For details, see docs/GASNet-EX.txt for gex_VIS_SetPeerCompletionHandler
    + VIS Puts now offer local completion support.
      For details, see docs/GASNet-EX.txt for GEX_FLAG_ENABLE_LEAF_LC
  - gasnet_fwd.h now provides a dependency-free useful subset of the API
    declarations, suitable for inclusion into application-level code.

* Feature implementation status in this release:
  - VIS Peer Completion is well-implemented for shared memory. The distributed-memory 
    implementation is functionally complete and will be tuned in an upcoming release.
  - Collective operations use "reliable performance" algorithms based on Binomial Trees. 
    They have not yet been tuned for shared memory or offload.
  - ReduceToOne supports all operations on built-in types, including user-defined 
    commutative operations, but currently limits the local size of the operands.
  - Teams currently use a dense representation, a scalable implementation is forthcoming.

* Notable bugs fixed in this release:
  - Bug3749: assertion failure in PSHM's NP-AM
  - See fixes listed in the GASNet-1 1.32.0 ChangeLog below


----------------------------------------------------------------------
03-28-2018: GASNet-EX 2018.3.0 Release

* GASNet-EX Spec v0.4:
  - Renamed gex_System_QueryNeighborhoodInfo() and associated
    types and constants to gex_System_QueryNbrhdInfo() and similar.
  - Adjusted payload limit queries to accommodate Negotiated-Payload AM.
  - Remote Atomics: added flags for asserting locality properties
  - Remote Atomics: added flags for requesting memory fencing behavior
  - Strided: now supports transpose/reflection operations
  - Added gex_ep (destination endpoint) to gex_Token_Info_t
  - AM Request/Reply/Commit functions may now optionally omit the arg count
    suffix on the function name when using compilers with __VA_ARG__ support
    (added in C99/C++11, may also be available in older compilers).
  - Minor clarifications throughout.

* Major new features implemented in this release:
  - Remote Atomics and Negotiated-Payload Active Messages have been
    further specialized to improve performance on aries-conduit.
  - Remote Atomics performance improvements for shared-memory bypass.
  - Strided has been completely re-implemented and now supports N-d
    transpose/reflection operations. Notable performance improvements throughout.
  - VIS performance improvements, most notably for shared-memory bypass and
    aries-conduit (where some in-memory copies have been removed)
  - The 64k per-thread limit on in-flight explicit handle ops has been removed.
    The number of in-flight ops is now limited only by available heap memory.

* Notable bugs fixed in this release:
  - Bug3704: allow gasnet.h and gasnetex.h to be included in either order
  - Improved assertion checks and error messages in various places.

* Feature implementation status in this release:
  - Negotiated-Payload Active Messages are well-implemented for shared memory
    (PSHM and smp-conduit), gemini- and aries-conduits.  All other conduit are
    currently using a portable reference implementation which may result in
    performance less than will eventually be delivered.
  - Remote Atomics are well-implemented for shared memory (PSHM on most systems,
    and smp-conduit) and aries-conduit.  Other conduits with APIs for offloaded
    atomics do not yet utilize them.

  - GASNet-1 handles generalized to EX events
  - Most gasnet_ identifiers have new versions in the gex_ namespace
  - Most interfaces now accept flags for extensible fine-tuning of behavior

* Legacy backward-compatibility layer:
  - gasnet.h now contains an implementation of GASNet-1 spec v1.8 in terms
    of the new EX interfaces.
  - Both layers interoperate freely so that legacy client code can be incrementally
    migrated to use of the new EX interfaces and features.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
The remainder of this file contains the unmodified ChangeLog from the GASNet-1
code base, from which the EX code was branched.
Note some entries below do not apply to the EX branch.

  discovered since the 1.26.3 release.

* InfiniBand Verbs (ibv-conduit)
  - Clients written in C++ would fail to link with undefined references
    to gasnetc_amrdma_balance.
  - A build of ibv-conduit configured using --disable-ibv-rcv-thread

    to reflect intended defaulting priority.
  - Downgrade ofi and portals4 conduits to "portable" conduits in startup
    code that checks and warns about the availability of native conduits.
  - Many improvements to conduit documentation

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-23-2016 :  Release 1.26.3

* This release fixes three significant bugs affecting udp-conduit:
  - Out-of-order delivery of UDP messages (which can occur on networks
    with multiple paths) was going undetected and could lead to silent
    loss and/or erroneous redelivery of AMs in the presence of
    retransmissions (caused by packet loss or high network load).
  - On Cygwin 2.5 (2016-04-11 and later), ioctl(FIONREAD) always returns
    failure, rendering udp-conduit entirely unusable on that platform.
  - On FreeBSD, ioctl(FIONREAD) may truncate long datagrams to around
    600 bytes, rendering udp-conduit unusable on that platform.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-12-2016 :  Release 1.26.2

  - Improved support for Cygwin-2.5

* Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR)
  This release is the first to include (experimental) support for
  system-level checkpoint and restart using BLCR

* New conduits (network APIs) added:
  This is the first public release of two new conduits: OFI and PSM.
  Both are believed to be complete and correct, but have not yet been
  subjected to as thorough testing and tuning as other conduits.
  - ofi-conduit
    OpenFabrics Interfaces (OFI) is not a vendor or hardware-specific API.
    It is a framework focused on exporting fabric communication services
    to applications.  OFI is best described as a collection of libraries
    and applications used to export fabric services.
    The ofi-conduit code was contributed by Intel Corporation.
    See ofi-conduit/README for additional details.
  - psm-conduit
    This conduit runs over the PSM 2.0 API supported by Intel's Omni-Path
    fabric.  There is no support for the PSM 1.x API.

        gasnet_barrier(id, flags)
    + Barrier matching results query (for building of hierarchical
      implementation which require UPC-style name matching)
        int is_anonymous = gasnet_barrier_result(&value_if_not_anon);

  - With this release support for the Gemini interconnect of the Cray
    XE and XK series systems has graduated out of BETA status.
  - Significantly improved performance via uGNI's "RELAXED_PI_ORDERING",
    increased overlap in non-blocking operations, and a lower latency
    mechanism for small Puts.

* IBM PAMI (pami-conduit)
  - Updated to support BlueGene/Q driver V1R2M0
  - BlueGene/Q users are advised to use V1R2M0 + efix 23 (or newer)
    if using GASNET_PAR mode.  Prior to efix 23, memset() in the BG/Q
    C runtime was not thread safe, and this was responsible for the
    "unexplained failures" noted in GASNet's 1.18.2 release notes.

* NEW Beta support for Portals 4.x API (portals4-conduit)
  - This release includes BETA support for the Portals 4.x API as
    implemented at https://code.google.com/p/portals4/
  - This initial implementation does not yet include "native" Put
    or Get support, using the AM-based reference implementation instead.

* InfiniBand (ibv- and vapi-conduits)
  - Can control the IB MTU size via environment variable GASNET_MAX_MTU.
  - Automatically ignore unsupported iWARP adapters.

* PSHM (intra-node shared memory)
  - Add the GASNET_SUPERNODE_MAXSIZE environment variable to control the
    grouping of cores on a compute node into multiple GASNet "supernodes".

* Platform support/portability
  - Added support for THUMB2 mode of recent ARM processors
  - Work around a bug in Clang++ building udp-conduit (GASNet bug 3129)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-30-2012 : Release 1.20.0

* IBM PAMI (pami-conduit)
  - With this release PAMI conduit has graduated out of BETA status.
  - This release now implements GASNet's collectives via the PAMI
    collectives, yielding much-improved performance in many cases.
  - A faster default barrier implementation (PAMIDISSEM).

* Cray XE & XK series (gemini-conduit)
  - Improved performance for 129 to 4096 byte transfers.
  - This release includes *experimental* support (OFF by default) for
    improved performance via uGNI's "RELAXED_PI_ORDERING", which can be
    enabled using an environment variable.
    See the conduit README for more information.

* Mellanox ConnectX series HCAs (mxm-conduit)
  - This is the first official release of GASNet support for the "MXM" API
    for recent Mellanox's InfiniBand HCAs.  This is based on the code which
    Mellanox has been distributing for about one year.

* Mellanox Fabric Collective Accelerator (FCA)
  - Optional collectives acceleration using Mellanox's FCA which works with
    both ibv-conduit and mxm-conduit on recent Mellanox HCAs.
  - See other/fca/README-fca.txt for details

* PSHM (intra-node shared memory)
  - Active Messages over shared-memory have been reimplemented using
    Nemesis lock-free queues, yielding improved performance and lowering
    the memory required from quadratic to linear in cores-per-node.
  - Intra-node barrier has been reimplemented for higher performance.
  - Support for up to about 45K processes/node (vs. default of 255) is
    now available as a configure option: --enable-large-pshm.  This has
    been tested to 4096 proc/node.  However, memory and other resources,
    such as file descriptors, will typically impose a much lower limit.

* General
  - A new barrier implementation (an RDMA-based dissemination algorithm)
    replaces the previous default (AM-based dissemination) for most
    network conduits.
  - Barrier matching rules in "corner-cases" have been revised to match
    the semantics expected to appear in the UPC 1.3 specification.  The
    changes legalize some calling cases which were previously erroneous.
    No cases which were legal before have become illegal.
  - SLURM integration in ssh-spawner.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-14-2012 : Release 1.18.2

* IBM PAMI (pami-conduit)
  - This release includes a BETA of native support for the IBM PAMI
    (Parallel Active Message Interface) network API, found on the IBM BG/Q
    and on systems running IBM's Parallel Environment (IBM PE) software
    for Linux (both x86-64 and PowerPC architectures).
  - Testing on an IBM Power 775 system (a.k.a. PERCS or Blue Waters) with
    its HFI network passed all GASNet and Berkeley UPC tests.
  - Testing on an IBM BlueGene/Q shows there are still some unexplained
    failures at the time of this release.
  - This code has not yet been tested on IBM PE clusters running PAMI over
    InfiniBand or Ethernet.  Reports of such testing would be appreciated.
    Access to such systems for testing would be GREATLY appreciated.
  - The performance of pami-conduit has not been fully tuned, however we
    believe that the implementation is correct (with only minor bugs
    remaining on BlueGene/Q).
  - This is still only a BETA-quality implementation, and performance
    improvements are anticipated in future releases.

* Cray XE & XK series (gemini-conduit)
  - Added Cray XK series as a supported/tested platform.
  - Reduced by more than 60% the memory used for receiving AMs (bug 3067).
  - Made several code cleanups on the road to production-quality.
  - This conduit is still "BETA" due to known room for improvements.

* InfiniBand (ibv- and vapi-conduits)
  - Improved scalability (time and memory) of startup/shutdown code
    + Switch to native InfiniBand communication earlier in startup.
    + Use more scalable communication pattern for exit coordination.
    + Made communications performance improvements to sockets code in the
      ssh-spawner used for startup when spawning via MPI is unavailable
      or has been disabled.
  - Made improvements to dynamic connection support
    + The dynamic connection code has been more robust in the face of lost
      packets through use of TCP-inspired adaptive timeouts.
    + The dynamic connection code has been made insensitive to the problem
      of inattentive peers (ones not making frequent enough calls to GASNet)
      through the use of an internal thread which wakes up only on arrival
      of network traffic related to dynamic connection setup.
  - Made improvements in the Active Message progress thread
    + The AM progress thread is finally available in ibv-conduit.
    + The maximum wake-up rate of the progress thread can now be limited.
    + See the conduit README file for documentation on GASNET_RCV_THREAD
      and GASNET_RCV_THREAD_RATE environment variables for more info.

* PSHM (intra-node shared memory)
  - Extended PSHM-via-XPMEM support to SGI Altix series, where it is
    available at configure time, but not currently used by default.
  - Support for PSHM over SystemV shared memory no longer requires a
    working implementation of mmap() (bug 3066).
    + This is the first PSHM support for Cygwin.
  - Expanded PSHM docs, including notes for configuration on Cygwin.
    See the top-level GASNet README for details.

* Platform support/portability
  - Ported network-independent code to the IBM BlueGene/Q.
    This provides fully-functioning GASNet-Tools and smp- and mpi-conduits.
  - Implemented native 64-bit atomics for ILP32 builds with Apple XCode-4.x,
    resolving bug 3071 which required disabling them in the 1.18.0 release.
  - Force PGI compilers on MacOS to honor the documented ABI (bug 2150).
  - Made several changes to ssh-spawner sockets code for better portability.
  - Disabled ASLR (address-space layout randomization) in MacOS Lion (and
    newer) via the GASNET_LDFLAGS.
  - No longer trust Cygwin's gethostid(), which has known problem.
  - Added initial support for Clang (bug 3075).
    + Not yet listed in README as officially supported for any target
    + x86 and x86-64 targets have been well tested on Linux and *BSD
    + x86 and x86-64 targets have been lightly tested on MacOS Lion
    + ppc64 target has been lightly tested on BG/Q platforms
  - Made fixes for __attribute__ configure probes
    + The __always_inline__ probe failed incorrectly with gcc-4.7.x.
    + The __format__ probe failed incorrectly with PGI compilers.
  - Improved support for "old" C compilers by removing or reducing
    unnecessary C99 dependencies.

* General
  - Fixed an error in README's instructions for use of the Makefile
    fragments, which was missing "$(GASNET_CPPFLAGS)" in the ".c.o" rule.
  - Continued improvement to signal handling for smp-conduit for fewer
    "orphans" when an application is terminated by a signal or abort().
  - Implemented/documented GASNET_THREAD_STACK_{MIN,PAD} environment vars.
  - Annotated many (but not yet all) known-benign memory leaks in the
    report generated when GASNET_MALLOCFILE is set (for bug 3088).
  - Improved documentation (in code comments) for conduit implementers.

* Build and configure
  - Most instances of "debug vs. optimize compilation conflict" in the
    MPI compiler are now resolved without user intervention.
  - Support for GASNet's error-checking implementation of malloc and its
    associates can now be controlled independent of the --enable-debug
    configure option (but is still enabled by default when configured
    with --enable-debug).  This resolves bug 3089.
    + "--enable-debug-malloc" enables error-checking malloc while not
      enabling other runtime assertions associated with "--enable-debug".
    + "--enable-debug --disable-debug-malloc" yields a debug build without
      GASNet's error-checking wrappers for malloc and related calls.  This
      is useful when an external debugging malloc library is to be used.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Cray-XE series (gemini-conduit):
  - This release includes a BETA of native support for the Cray XE network.
  - The performance of gemini-conduit has not been tuned, however we believe

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-17-2011 : Release 1.17.6
* A "stable snapshot" - first release candidate for 1.18.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
09-23-2011 : Release 1.17.4 (gemini-conduit only beta release)

  - This is a Beta release featuring an initial native implementation
    for the Gemini interconnect of the Cray XE.
  - The performance of gemini-conduit has not been tuned, but we believe
    that the implementation is correct.
  - Relative to the previous stable release, 1.16.2, this Beta includes
    several miscellaneous changes not described here.  Most are fixes for
    bugs or improvements to performance, and none are suspected to make
    this release any less stable than 1.16.2.
  - This Beta has been mostly tested on Cray XE6 systems, but is not
    known or suspected to be less stable on any other specific platforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

      specification which can greatly reduce the memory and HCA resource
      requirements for large node counts, when used together with SRQ.
      For more details on SRQ and XRC see vapi-conduit/README (source)
      or share/doc/gasnet/README-ibv (installed).
    + This release adds support for operating ibv- and vapi-conduits
      without connecting all pairs of nodes at startup (avoiding the
      associated costs in time, memory and HCA resources).
      For more information see vapi-conduit/README (source) or

    + GASNET_BACKTRACE_NODES - limits GASNET_BACKTRACE output
    + GASNET_TRACENODES      - limits GASNET_TRACEFILE output
    + GASNET_STATSNODES      - limits GASNET_STATSFILE output
    + GASNET_MALLOCNODES     - limits GASNET_MALLOCFILE output

* InfiniBand (ibv-conduit):
  - This release features a (re)implementation of Active Messages for
    ibv-conduit via SRQ (Shared Receive Queue) which greatly reduces
    the memory requirements for large node counts.
  - Implementation now supports (in theory) as many as 65535 GASNet
    nodes (processes), up from 16384.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-24-2010 : Release 1.15.8
* A "stable snapshot" - second release candidate for 1.16.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
10-17-2010 : Release 1.15.6
* A "stable snapshot" - first release candidate for 1.16.0

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2010 : Release 1.15.4 (ibv-conduit only beta release)
  - This is a Beta release featuring an initial (re)implementation of
    Active Messages for ibv-conduit via SRQ (Shared Receive Queue).
  - SRQ is an InfiniBand API mechanism for more scalable memory usage as
    the number of connected peers increases.
  - In previous releases of ibv-conduit each additional peer required an
    additional GASNET_AM_CREDITS_PP buffers (32 by default) be allocated
    for receiving AM traffic.  At 4KB per buffer plus additional metadata
    for management, this would amount to about 133KB per peer.
  - The introduction of SRQ allows ibv-conduit to operate with no more
    than 1024 AM receive buffers (4MB + management overheads) independent
    of the number of peers, with little or no performance impact on well-
    behaved applications.
  - This initial implementation is known to deadlock under very rare AM-
    intensive workloads, or when certain settings are reduced to values
    much lower than their defaults.  This will be resolved in the next
    Beta, prior to the 1.16.0 release.
  - There is no SRQ implementation for vapi-conduit.
  - Relative to the previous stable release, 1.14.2, this Beta includes
    several miscellaneous changes not described here.  Most are fixes for
    bugs or improvements to performance, and none are suspected to make
    this release any less stable than 1.14.2.
  - This Beta has been mostly tested on ibv-conduit systems, but is not
    known or suspected to be less stable on any other specific platforms.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
05-20-2010 : Release 1.14.2

  - add workaround for a recent LAPI performance bug on Federation hardware
  - gasnet_exit stability improvements

* elan-conduit:
  - upgrades for recent libelan versions

* Configure changes:
  - add autodetection of all conduits, whenever possible. On some systems one
    may still need to  set some environment variables before running configure
    to indicate the install location of network drivers.
  - detect and reject the buggy gcc 3.2.0-2 compilers
  - handle systems lacking pthreads

----------------------------------------------------------------------
11-10-2003 : Release 1.3

* Added InfiniBand support in vapi-conduit - currently only SEGMENT_FAST is supported

* elan-conduit: 
  - updated for the most recent version of libelan
  - fix a few race conditions

* gm-conduit:
  - updated for GM 2.0, including RDMA get support
  - Added 64-bit support
  - Reworked the spawner to work with mpiexec, gexec, MPICH mpirun and a custom spawner

* lapi-conduit:
  - Fix bugs related to varying LAPI uhdr payload size across systems - this is
    now queried automatically at runtime

* GASNet spec: 
  - gasnet_hold_interrupts() and gasnet_resume_interrupts() calls are now
    required to be ignored by the implementation within an AM handler context.
  - Added gasnet_set_waitmode() function

* Add a logGP test program for GASNet conduits

* Add a threaded tester for gasnet threaded clients

* Added a GASNet/MPI test that tests the compatibility of a GASNet conduit with
  MPI calls made by the GASNet client. 

* All GASNet conduits other than gm are now fully compatible with limited MPI
  calls from the GASNet client code. In order to prevent deadlock and ensure
  safety, GASNet and MPI communication should be separated by barriers.

* Factor the firehose page registration system into a new, separate firehose
  library with a public interface, for use by gm-conduit and vapi-conduit
 
* Use "adaptive" pthreads mutexes on Linux (when available), for better SMP performance

* Added support for new platforms: Solaris-SPARC 64-bit 
  and new compilers:  Portland Group C, SunPro C and Intel C

* Add SIGCONT as an additional option for unfreezing a GASNet application
  This is a useful option for debugging GASNet apps which lack debugging symbols
  (but may still have enough info to give you a stack trace, etc) A GASNet app
  frozen by GASNET_FREEZE can now be unfrozen by sending: "kill -CONT pid"
  to each process, or on some systems by typing control-Z on the console to
  suspend the process and then fg to resume it (sends a SIGCONT for you).

* HSL calls now compile away to nothing when HSL's are unnecessary 

* Merged AMMPI v0.8, includes fixes to rare buffer overflows and small memory leaks

* fixed pthread barrier errors caused by a race condition

* Minor semantic change to no-interrupt sections -
  gasnet_{hold,resume}_interrupts() are now officially ignored within a GASNet
  handler context (where interrupts are already suspended anyhow). 

* add new function gasnet_set_waitmode() to control waiting behavior

* Use an atexit handler to make sure we finalize the trace/stats file, even 
  if the client exits without calling gasnet_exit

* Fixes to gasneti_local_membar(), especially for SMP/UNI Linux kernels and PowerPC

* New significant GASNet conduit programming practices:
  gasneti_{malloc,calloc,free}, gasneti_assert, GASNETI_CLIENT_THREADS,
  GASNETI_CONDUIT_THREADS, (N)DEBUG -> GASNET_(N)DEBUG, STATS,TRACE ->
  GASNET_{STATS,TRACE}

* Many minor fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
06-28-2003 : Release 1.2

* Greatly increased the number of platforms supported - notably, this release
  adds support for FreeBSD, IRIX, HPUX, Solaris, MSWindows-Cygwin and Mac OSX,
  as well as the SunPro, MIPSPro, Portland Group and Intel C compilers. See the
  top-level README for the complete list of supported platforms.

* Added the smp-conduit, which implements pure loopback to support GASNet
  clients on platforms lacking a network.

* Remove 256-node scalability limit - mpi, elan and lapi conduits now
  theoretically scale to 2^31 nodes. gm conduit scales to 2^16 nodes.

* Merge v0.7 of AMMPI - improved latency performance, better scalability, and
  fixes for LAM/MPI

* Fix bug 120 - gasnet_exit now reliably kills the entire job on all conduits
  in various collective and non-collective invocation situations.

* New switches GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSLOCAL and GASNETE_PUTGET_ALWAYSREMOTE which
  optimize away the locality check for put/gets implemented by
  gasnete_islocal() 

* Updates to the tracing system - separate statistics from tracing to allow
  finer user control controlled by new environment variables - GASNET_STATSMASK
  and GASNET_STATSFILE

* Major cleanup to the gm-conduit bootstrap code

* Internal structural changes to gasnet_extended.h to provide more flexibility
  for conduit overrides

* Minor wording clarifications to the GASNet spec

* Many minor bug fixes

----------------------------------------------------------------------
04-17-2003 : Release 1.1

* Added lots of conduit user and design documentation
* Fix bugs with gasnet_register_value_t functionality, in some cases garbage 
  was returned by gasnet_get_val() in the upper bytes
* Fix bug 51 - endianness bugs on gasnet_*_val()
* Tweak the gcc optimizer settings to ensure that we get full inlining
* Ensure gasnet_exit() or fatal signals always correctly shut down the global 
  job (mpi and elan conduits - gm and lapi still have known problems)
* Add strong configure warnings about using gcc 2.96 - users are highly 
  recommended to avoid this broken compiler
* Ensure configure caching is always on
* Basic infrastructure cleanups to the conduit Makefile fragments
* Fix a shutdown-time crash when tracing
* Add GASNET_CONFIG_STRING to spec & implementation and embed it in library
* Add a number of minor clarifications to the GASNet spec
* Clean up licensing issues

* elan-conduit: 
 - fixups for better handling of elan memory exhaustion
 - preallocate AMLong bounce buffers

* gm-conduit:
