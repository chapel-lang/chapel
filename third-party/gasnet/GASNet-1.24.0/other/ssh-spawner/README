README file for ssh-spawner
================================
Paul H. Hargrove <PHHargrove@lbl.gov>

Configure Options:
  --disable-pdeathsig (auto-detect by default)
    On Linux, it is possible to request a signal be delivered to a
    process when its parent process dies.  This can be used by the
    ssh-based spawner to reduce the possibility of orphan (run away)
    processes in certain abnormal termination scenarios.  
    Because are 2.4.x versions of Linux on which use of this option
    can lock up the machine (as the result of a kernel bug), this
    option is disabled for kernels prior to 2.6.0, and can also be
    explicitly disabled at configure time.

  --with-ssh-{cmd,options,nodefile,rate}=<VALUE>
    These control the default values used when the corresponding
    environment variables are not set.  These environment variables
    are documented below.

  --with-ssh-topology={flat,nary[:<N>]} (default is "flat")
    This sets the topology used for the ssh connections.

    The value "flat" uses an implementation in which the initial
    "master" process is NOT a GASNet process, but is the parent
    of ALL of the ssh processes.  This approach is not scalable
    due to the number of TCP sockets required.  However, if run
    from a "service node" it is usable even when ssh among the
    compute nodes is not possible.

    The value "nary" uses a tree with GASNet node 0 as the root
    and a default out-degree set by the optional suffix.  For
    instance "nary:2" uses a binary tree.  This implementation
    is more scalable (in both time and sockets) than the "flat"
    one, but requires that ssh among compute nodes is permitted.
    There is still a "master" process that is the parent of
    GASNet node 0, allowing for the possibility that the job is
    started on a "service node".

Environment Variables: (may be controlled by a wrapper script)


+ A list of hosts is specified using either the GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE
  or GASNET_SSH_SERVERS environment variables.
  If set, the variable GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE specifies a file with one
  hostname per line.  Blank lines and comment lines (using '#') are
  ignored.  For sites using a static hosts file, a default may be
  set for this variable at configure time using the option
  --with-ssh-nodefile=<FILENAME>.
  If set, the variable GASNET_SSH_SERVERS itself contains a list of
  hostnames, delimited by commas or whitespace.
  If both are set, GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE takes precedence.
  Note that if starting a job via upcrun or tirun, these variables
  may be set for you from other sources.
  The following environment variables set by supported batch systems
  are also recognized if the GASNET_* variables are not set:
    PBS:    PBS_NODEFILE
    LSF:    LSB_HOSTS
    SGE:    PE_HOSTFILE
    SLURM:  Use `scontrol show hostname` if SLURM_JOB_ID is set

+ The environment variable GASNET_SSH_CMD can be set to specify a
  specific remote shell (perhaps rsh), without arguments (see below).
  If the value does not begin with "/" then $PATH will be searched
  to resolve a full path.  The default value is "ssh", unless an
  other value has been configured using --with-ssh-cmd=<VALUE>.

+ The environment variable GASNET_SSH_OPTIONS can be set to
  specify options that will precede the hostname in the commands
  used to spawn jobs.  One example, for OpenSSH, would be
    GASNET_SSH_OPTIONS="-o 'StrictHostKeyChecking no'"
  The parsing of the value follows the same rules for quotes (both
  single and double) and backslash as most shells.  A default
  value may be configured using --with-ssh-options=<VALUE>.

+ The environment variable GASNET_SSH_REMOTE_RATE can be set to
  limit the number of ssh connections per second to any given
  host. The value 0 means no limit is imposed.
  Default value is 20.

+ The environment variable GASNET_SSH_REMOTE_PATH can be set to
  specify the working directory (defaults to current).

+ Users of OpenSSH should NOT add "-f" to GASNET_SSH_OPTIONS.  Doing
  so causes the spawner to mistakenly believe that a process it
  spawned has exited.
  However, if agent forwarding or X11 forwarding are normally
  enabled in your configuration, "-a" and "-x" can be used with
  OpenSSH to disable them and speed the connection process (except
  where the agent forwarding is needed for authorization).

+ If the "nary" topology was selected at configure time, then the
  environment variable GASNET_SSH_OUT_DEGREE can be used to set
  the degree of the N-ary tree.  A value of 0 is equivalent to an
  unlimited value (but is NOT the same as the "flat" topology
  since process 0, rather then the master process, is the parent
  of the other processes).
  

Command-line Usage:

If running a UPC or Titanium application, then language-specific
commands upcrun or tirun should be used instead.  In other cases
it is advisable to use a GASNet conduit-specific spawner script
such as gasnetrun_ibv or gasnetrun_mxm.  However, if you find
you must use the ssh-spawner directly, the following apply:

+ usage summary:
    your_app [-v] N[:M] [--] [args ...]
  where N is the number of processes to run, and M is the number of
  nodes/hosts over which the processes will be distributed.  If only
  N is given, then M=N by default.


Troubleshooting:

For the following, the term "compute node"  means one of the hosts
given by GASNET_SSH_NODEFILE or GASNET_SSH_SERVERS, which will run
an application process.  The term "master node" means the node from
which the job was spawned.  The master node may be one of the
compute nodes, but this is not required.

+ The ssh (or rsh) at your site must be configured to allow logins
  from the master node to compute nodes, and among the compute nodes.
  These must be achieved without interaction (such as entering a
  password or accepting new hostkeys).
  For OpenSSH users, the following options are used automatically
    "-o 'StrictHostKeyChecking no' -o 'BatchMode yes'"
  which should ensure that ssh does not try to prompt the user.

+ Any firewall or port filtering must allow the ssh/rsh connections
  described above, plus TCP connections on an "untrusted port" (ports
  with numbers over 1024) from a compute node to the master node and
  and among compute nodes.

+ Resolution for all given hostnames must be possible from both the
  master node and the compute nodes if the NARY topology is used.
  In all cases the compute nodes must be capable of resolving the
  hostname of the master.

+ If you see errors starting a large number of processes per node,
  but have no trouble with a lesser number, then you may need to
  raise one or both of the following in your sshd's configuration:
    MaxSessions 
    MaxStartups
  If you do not have the ability to change these, a lower value
  of the GASNET_SSH_RATE environment variable may allow you to
  work-around a too small value of MaxStartups.
