===========================================================================

This file contains the main features as well as overviews of specific
bug fixes (and other actions) for each version of PLPA since
version 1.0.

1.0.3
-----

- Resolve some sizing / units ambiguities that mistakenly did not make
  it into 1.0.1.  Thanks to Bert Wesarg for pointing these problems out.


1.0.2
-----

- Ensure that plpa_sched_[set|get]affinity() returns 0 upon success.
  Thanks to David Creasy for bringing this to our attention.


1.0.1
-----

- Specify that cpusetsize should be in units of bytes and add some
  missing "* 8"'s in plpa_dispatch.c.


1.0
---

- Initial release.


0.9a2
-----

- Change the back-end type of the plpa_bitmask_t to unsigned long
  instead of unsigned char to avoid an endian problem.
- No longer attempt to set the affinity in plpa_api_probe() to avoid a
  possible race condition (setting it after getting it).
- Fix PLPA_CPU_ZERO macro.  Thanks to Bogdan Costescu for pointing
  this out.


0.9a1
-----

Initial public release.
