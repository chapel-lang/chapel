ToDo List:

+ General Code Cleanup
	  + Add Better Comments
	  + Updating Design Doc

+ Pipelining for large messages (fix or work around req for MERGE TO HEAD)

+ Gather/Scatter/All Gather
	+ Sort of Done

+ Flush out Computational Collectives
	+ Prefix Reduce/All reduce
	+ Reduce

+ Code Walkthrough
        + 

+ Multithreading
	+ Locking
	+ Multiple images (esp for non-rooted collectives)
	+ non-rooted / local address
	+ shared memory

+ Barrier Teams
	+ Take a look at Pthread Barrier
	
+ Teams (bigger open issue)
	+ Team/Group Constructors
	+ Team Collectives
	+ Hooking it up to UPC level
	+ Ensure that existing gasnet code works for teams
	+ Team Tester
	       + Take testcoll and modify it

+ Local Address (work-around) 
	+ Non-seg aligned     
	+ test rand implementation

+ Rendez-vous based approach for LOCAL collectives w/pipelining

+ Merge Collective Spec into Gasnet Spec 
	+ formalization of the collectives.txt file

+ Shared Memory Style Collectives (optimization)
	+ raw puts on shmem

+ Higher Radix Bruck's (low priority)

+ Scratch Space (Logging) (optimizations)

+ Better Tree Construction (optimization)
	+ DFS ordering
	+ MPICH a2a algorithms (permission to send?)

+ Better Geometry Cache (optimization)

+ Finishing Syncflags support (optimization)
	+ Getting NO/NO performance 

+ Autotuning ... a ways off
 
+ Literature Search for collective implementations 

+ ASync Log for nonblocking collectives and out-no synch collectives

+ Conduit-specific tuning


Incremental Merge 
+ gasnet_coll.h
+ Eager Threshold (tuneable)
+ spec
