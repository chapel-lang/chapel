README file for mpi-spawner
================================
Paul H. Hargrove <PHHargrove@lbl.gov>

See ibv-conduit for an example of how to use this code in a conduit.

When using the mpi-spawner, the following apply:

+ usage summary:
    mpirun -np N your_app [args ...]
  where N is the number of processes to run.
  If running a UPC or Titanium application, then language-specific
  commands should be used instead.

+ In order to use this spawner, a working MPI must be installed
  and configured on your system.  See mpi-conduit/README for
  information on configuring GASNet for a particular MPI.  Note that
  you must compile mpi-conduit as well (even if you never plan to use
  it).

+ Since that MPI is only used in gasnet_init(), gasnet_attach() and
  gasnet_exit() and not for any GASNet communications.  Therefore
  it is acceptable to use a TCP/IP based MPI such as MPICH or LAM/MPI.
