GASNet autotuner usage and design notes
=======================================

* Interface:

Collective Index is a tuple: 
  Machine, Number of Nodes, Threads Per Node, Sync Mode,
  Address Mode, Collective, and Size

Modes of Operation:

0) No Tuning (default)
 -- All collectives use their default implementations, as controlled
    by the GASNET_COLL_* family of environment variables.

1) Read Existing Tuning Data
 -- A tuning file can specified through an environment variable:
      GASNET_COLL_TUNING_FILE
    or by a function call
      gasnet_coll_loadTuningState(char *filename, GASNET_TEAM_ALL);
    to be invoked collectively by all threads that have called
    gasnet_coll_init().
    For scalability node 0 does the file I/O and broadcasts the data.

2) Search and Append to Tuning State
 -- Tuner state starts with either the data load as above, or with an empty
    database.  The first time a particular collective operation (defined
    by the tuple above) is called a search is performed if enabled by
      GASNET_COLL_ENABLE_SEARCH=yes
    in the environment variable.  The best algorithm determined by the search
    is added to the state.  If the initial state is non-empty, then the search
    is not performed for tuples already present in the database.

3) Search and Save Tuning Data
 -- Like search but the tuning data is then stored to a file so that
    it can be used for later runs.  To save the tuning file the user
    must invoke (collectively, as with gasnet_coll_loadTuningState()):
      gasnet_coll_dumpTuningState(char *filename, GASNET_TEAM_ALL);
    There is no environment variable equivalent.

=======================================

* Typical Usage:

Typical users will most likely be using a combination of Modes 2 and 3
through the environment variables and calls to
gasnet_coll_dumpTuningState().

Case 1) on-line tuning
  The simplest method for running the automatic tuner is by using the
  yes/no "GASNET_COLL_ENABLE_SEARCH" environment variable.  With this
  enabled, every time a collective is invoked the parameters are looked
  up in a pre-cached table.  This table is indexed on (synchronization
  flags, number of threads per node, number of nodes, address mode,
  collective size (bytes)).  If the user requests a collective and it
  has been run before, the result of the previous search is applied and
  no further tuning happens.  However if portion of the tuple is new to
  the index a search is invoked.  Thus if the program has a few
  collectives (defined by the above tuple) that are invoked many times
  the tuning cost will only be incurred once per collective tuple.
  However, if the collectives are constantly changing then this could
  adversely impact performance by unnecessarily tuning.  In order to
  invoke the autotuner in this mode one can simply sets the environment
  variable:
   GASNET_COLL_ENABLE_SEARCH=yes

  In some cases we wish to save and restore tuning state across
  multiple runs of a program and GASNet allows this mode as well.  In
  this case the program is run with GASNET_COLL_ENABLE_SEARCH=yes as
  above.  In addition at the end of the run the program saves the data
  to a file by calling:
    gasnet_coll_dumpTuningState(char *filename, GASNET_TEAM_ALL);

Case 2) using saved data

  For subsequent program invocations in which we would like to reuse
  saved tuning information but not perform any search one would use
  the combination of:
    GASNET_COLL_ENABLE_SEARCH=no
    GASNET_COLL_TUNING_FILE=<path to tuning file>
  With this combination of environment variables the tuning data from
  the previous run are used.  When the program invokes a collective
  the closest match to what is already in the index and no additional
  searching is done

Case 3) tuning by proxy

  For large programs our recommended strategy is to run/create a
  smaller representative version of the program (e.g. few iterations
  of the main loop) with similar collectives and call the tuner on
  that smaller program, save the tuning state and then pass this
  tuning state to the full program.

Case 4) accumulation of data

  If the user wishes to augment the tuning history with more
  information one can run with the following environment variables:
    GASNET_COLL_ENABLE_SEARCH=yes 
    GASNET_COLL_TUNING_FILE=<path to tuning file> 
  In this mode the tuning data from a previous run are loaded, but if
  the program invokes a collective which is not found in the index
  then a search is invoked and added to the index.  One may optionally
  call gasnet_coll_dumpTuningState() to save this data (and may repeat
  this cycle as many times as desired).

NOTE: Since the tuning file is read and written from the GASNet
programs themselves, the files must be accessible to the compute nodes
(or wherever the GASNet programs are actually run)
