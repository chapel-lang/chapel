User Information:
-----------------
The GASNet Portals conduit is being developed exclusively (at this time) for the 
Cray XT3 and follow-on Portals based systems.  The design and implementation is 
based on the Portals 3.3 Message Passing Interface (Revision 1.0) developed at 
Sandia National Laboratory and the University of New Mexico.

As of August 28, 2006, this implementation uses the existing MPI-Conduit for the 
GASNet Core active message layer and uses Portals directly for the more performance
sensitive Extended API (Put/Get) operations.  A full Portals implementation is expected
to be available by January 1, 2007.

NOTE: the MPI-Conduit is a portable GASNet conduit and is provided for convenience,
not performance.  

The Cray XT3 compute node operating system is Catamount.  Catamount provides a single
user thread of execution and limited operating system services.  The SeaStar 
communication processor manages the delivery and receipt of locally or remotely
generated RDMA operations.  Once a GASNet client issues a Portals RDMA operation, 
the seastar hardware will deliver it to the remote node and arrange for Events
to be generated during various phases of the operation.  The client or GASNet runtime
layer must actively poll the network to process these events, completing the 
associated GASNet operations.

* The current implementation is restricted to the GASNET_SEQ and GASNET_SEGMENT_FAST configuration.

Some notes on building GASNet for the Cray XT3
----------------------------------------------

* * * IMPORTANT:  Use of this conduit REQUIRES the GNU programming environment.  
      It will fail with the PGI programming environment.
      Before configuring GASNet or UPCR, switch to the GNU environment by typing:
       	   module switch PrgEnv-pgi PrgEnv-gnu

* Since the XT3 requires using a cross-compiler, there is a special cross
  configuration script located in $GASNET_SRC_DIR/other/contrib/cross-configure-crayxt3.
  Instructions are:

   cd $GASNET_SRC_DIR
   ln -s cother/contrib/cross-configure-crayxt3 .
   ./Bootstrap
   ./cross-configure-crayxt3
   make

* The Pittsburd Supercomputer Center uses "pbsyod", rather than the "yod" command to 
  launch jobs.
  When configuring GASNet, edit the cross-configure-crayxt3 file and modify the
  definition of MPIRUN_CMD to use "pbsyod" rather than "yod".

Recognized environment variables:
---------------------------------
GASNET_PORTAL_MAX_POLL_EVENTS=Num
This value specified the maximum number of Portals Events that will
be processed whenever the conduit Polls the network.  
The default value is 40.  
Increasing the value may increase the time spent processing events when Polling.  
Decreasing the value may cause events to build-up if the runtime is unable to 
poll the network frequently enough.
NOTE:  Setting GASNET_PORTAL_MAX_POLL_EVENTS=0 has the effect of setting
it to infinity.  That is, GASNet will process all outstanding Portals 
events on each Poll of the network.

GASNET_PORTAL_PUTGET_POLL=Num
This value specifies the number of GASNet Put/Get operations that may
execute before a call to poll the network is forced.  
The default value is 6.
An internal counter records the number of Put/Get calls that have been made 
and if, during a Put/Get call, the counter exceeds this value, a call to poll 
the network is made.  The counter is reset to zero whenever GASNet polls the network.
Increasing this value may increase latency of GASNet operations during periods
of heavy Put/Get usage (without intermediate polling) as operations are not
marked complete until the corresponding Portals events are processed.
Decreasing the value may reduce performance by forcing excessive calls to poll
the network, although the effect is probably minor.

GASNET_PORTAL_PUTGET_LIMIT=Num
This value specified the maximum number of Put/Get operations that may be
"in-flight" at any one time.  
The default value is 255.
An operation is in-flight during the time period from when it is issued until 
it has been completed (by the receipt and processing of the corresponding Portals events).
An internal counter records the number of in-flight Put/Get operations.  When
this value is exceeded, any additional Put or Get operations are delayed until
a previous operation has completed.  The network is continually polled during the 
delay.  This value should probably not be increased, as having too many outstanding
Portals operations may cause inefficiencies for the Portals implementation.
This value may be reduced to force fewer in-flight operations.

GASNET_PORTAL_NUM_TMPMD=Num
Portals Put and Get operations are RDMA operations between a local and remote
"Memory Descriptor".  Think of a Memory Descriptor (MD) as pinned and registered
memory.  In GASNet the destination of a Put operation and the source of a Get
operation is the shared memory segment on the target node, which is already covered
by an MD (In GASNET_FAST mode).  However, the source memory of a Put or destination
memory of a Get may not be covered.  Small Put and Get operations are usually 
copied through a pre-pinned bounce buffer but for larger Put and Get operations,
the source of the Put or destination of the Get must have a temporary MD constructed
for it.  This environment variable limits the total number of temporary MD's allowed
to be in use at any time.
The default value is 1024.  
If a Put or Get operation requires a temporary MD and the number in use exceeds this value, 
the operation will poll the network until one is available.  
NOTE: the value of GASNET_PORTAL_PUTGET_LIMIT is generally less than this value
and so it would be impossible (in the current implementation) for this value to
be exceeded.

In the next few months, the entire GASNet API will be implemented using only
Portals.  Primarily, this will mean implementing GASNet Short, Medium and 
Long active message Request and Reply operations using Portals RDMA operations.

==============================================================================

Design Overview:
----------------
At this point, the implementation is relatively straight-forward.   GASNet Put
and Get operations are implemented in terms of Portals PtlPutRegion and PtlGetRegion
operations.  

Portals Put and Get operations are RDMA operations between a local and remote "Memory
Descriptor".  A Memory Descriptor represents a pinned region of memory that is endowed 
with various properties, such as what type of events will be generated on the MD, which
operations are permitted to be performed on the MD, and how the memory is managed ("Locally"
or "Remotely").  In addition, Portals MDs can be Free Floating, or on an ordered list attached
to a Portals Table Entry.  MDs that are attached to a Portals Table Entry are accessable 
to remote agents as the target of Put or source of Get RDMA operations.  Such MDs have
a set of 64 bits called "Match-Bits".  These MDs may also have a mask called the "Ignore-bits",
which will be discussed below.

All Portals operations are non-blocking and do not return a handle.  Depending on 
how the associated memory descriptors are configured, Portals Put and Get operations
generate events on the source and destination memory descriptors.  When a Portals
Put operation is issued, the caller supplies the local source memory descriptor, but the 
remote destination memory descriptor is determined by specifying a portals table entry
index and a set of 64 match-bits.  When the packet header of the message arrives at the
destination node, the memory descriptors attached to that portals table entry are examined
in order.  The first MD that matches the Match-bits of the Put operation (after being masked
by the MD's Ignore-bits) is selected as the target MD.
A similar procedure happens for Get operations.  The caller of the Get operation specifies
the memory descriptor of the data destination, but the data source is specified
by a portals table entry and set of match-bits.

Depending on how an MD is configured, events will be generated based on underlying 
actions associated with Portals Put and Get operations.  The events used in this
GASNet implementation are:
PTL_EVENT_SEND_END   - a locally initiated Put operation has been sent
PTL_EVENT_ACK        - a locally initiated Put operation has reached its remote destination MD
PTL_EVENT_PUT_END    - a remotely initiated Put operation has completed on a local MD
PTL_EVENT_GET_END    - a remotely initiated Get operation has completed on a local MD
PTL_EVENT_REPLY_END  - a locally initiated Get operation has completed on a local MD

At startup the local shared memory segment (Remote Access Region or RAR) is allocated and
covered by two Portals Memory Descriptors: RAR_MD and RARAM_MD.
In addition, a bounce buffer region is allocated and covered with the ReqSB_MD 
memory descriptor.
A single Event Queue (EQ) is allocated with enough events to handle the maximum number
of Put/Get operations allowed at any time (see environment variable GASNET_PORTAL_PUTGET_LIMIT).

RAR_MD does not have a Portals event queue associated with it and therefore no events will be
generated when operations are performed on it.  It is linked on the Portals Table Entry at 
index RAR_PTE, with MATCH_BITS=0x00.  It is used as the target of GASNet Put and source of 
GASNet Get operations.

RARAM_MD is associated with the event queue (EQ) and is linked on the Portals
table entry at index RAR_PTE with MATCH_BITS=0x01.  It is uses as 
the source of a GASNet Put operation (when the source happens to lie within the
local RAR).  Similarly, it is used as the destination of a GASNet Get operation
when the destination lies in the local RAR.

Both RAR_MD and RARAM_MD are configured to ignore all but the lowest 4 bits of a
set of MATCH_BITS.

ReqSB_MD is associated with EQ.  It is a free-floating MD and therefore cannot be used
as the target of a remote Put or Get operation, only as the source of a Put or destination
of a locally initiated Get operation.  Further, this memory region is managed
by a simple "Chunk" allocator.  Currently, it allocates fixed-size, 1KB chunks.

Each GASNet Put or Get operation is associated with a GASNet handle, a polymorphic
typed object that records the state of the operation.  The objects can be referenced
by either a standard (64 bit) pointer, or a compact 24-bit representation that can
be converted to a pointer to the object.  

Consider the implementation of a non-blocking GASNet Put operation:

gasnet_handle_t gasnet_put_nb_bulk(void *dest, gasnet_node_t node, void *src, size_t nbytes);

* We know the destination node and virtual memory address of where the data is to be put.
  This region must lie within the RAR of the remote node.  We know the starting address of
  this RAR since this information was exchanged at job startup.  We know the RAR is 
  covered by the RAR_MD memory descriptor with MATCH_BITS=0x00 and we can compute the
  the (remote) offset from the start of this MD.

* There are several cases for determining the MD of the source memory region:
  (1) It lives within the local RAR.  If so, use the local RAR_MD as the source
      MD and compute the (local) offset as src - RAR_MD_start_address.
  (2) It does not live within the local RAR, but nbytes <= 1KB.  Allocate a chunk
      from ReqSB_MD and copy the data into this bounce buffer.  Compute the (local)
      offset of this chunk from the start of ReqSB_MD.
  (3) It does not live in the local RAR and is too big to be copied though a bounce
      buffer.  Allocate a temporary memory descriptor (TEMP_MD) to cover the 
      region to be sent.  Se the local_offset = 0.

* Allocate a gasnet_handle_t object and encode its 24-bit representation into a portion of
  the 64-bit MATCH_BITS that will be ignored by the remote memory descriptors (the upper 60 bits).
  The handle is marked "IN_FLIGHT".

* Issue the PtlPutRegion operation from the selected local MD and local_offset to the
  remote node, specifying the RAR_PTE portals table entry and MATCH_BITS as specified 
  above.  Request that an ACK event be delivered when the data has been written to the
  remote memory.

* return the gasnet_handle_t object to the client.

At some point later in time, the data will be sent to the remote node, generating a 
PTL_EVENT_SEND_END event on the local source MD.  In addition, when the data has been delivered to
the target memory, an PTL_EVENT_ACK event will delivered to the source MD.
At some point in time, the client or runtime layer will poll the network, processing outstanding
events.  For this Put operation, the events will cause the following action:

** The SEND_END event will be ignored by all memory descriptors for this operation.
** The ACK event will cause the following actions:
   - the 24 bit representation of the gasnet_handle_t object will be extracted from
     the MATCH_BITS in the event structure.  The 64-bit pointer to the object will be
     generate from the 24-bit representation.  The operation will be marked "DONE".
   - If the event occurred on the local RAR (case (1) above), no action is taken.
     If the event occurred on the ReqSB_MD (case (2)), this was a copy through a bounce
     buffer and the chunk is freed for re-use.
     If the event occurred on a TEMP_MD, the memory descriptor is "unlinked" (unpinned).

Finally, the next time the client or the runtime layer calls gasnet_wait_syncnb() or
gasnet_try_syncnb() with this handle, the handle is freed and the operation is complete.

GASNet Get operations are handled in a similar manner.  
All blocking operation poll the network until the desired operation is complete.
