LLVM README for Chapel
==========================

Chapel can be built (by setting CHPL_LLVM=llvm) to include LLVM
(http://llvm.org) in order to enable extern block support and LLVM code
generation.

For more information on the current support for LLVM within Chapel,
please refer to $CHPL_HOME/doc/technotes/README.llvm.  For more
information about LLVM itself, please refer to the website above or to
the README in the llvm/ subdirectory of this directory.

The version of LLVM used here is 3.6.
