MassiveThreads README for Chapel
================================

This copy of MassiveThreads is being released with Chapel for
convenience and uses a snapshot obtained from the MassiveThreads
team at:

   https://github.com/massivethreads/massivethreads

We have applied the following configuration settings for Chapel users
for simplicity:

* disabled worker thread binding with CPU (can be enabled at runtime
  by setting an environmental varibale MYTH_BIND_WORKERS=1)

* disabled the experimental scheduler
