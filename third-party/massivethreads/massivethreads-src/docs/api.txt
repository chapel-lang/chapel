There are three APIs of MassiveThreads.

(1) native API, which is C functions such as myth_create and
myth_join.

(2) pthread-compatible API, which is almost identical to that of
pthreads, but much faster.

(3) (C++ only) an API compatible with TBB's task_group class.  In a
nutshell, it provides the following interface.

class task_group {
  void run(function<void ()> f);
  void wait();
};

With C++ compiler supporting lambda expressions (e.g., g++ version >=
4.5), task parallel programs can be succinctly expressed.  See
examples/task_group/fib.cc for examples.
