This directory contains code for x86-64 processors with fast
implementations of SSE operations, hence the name "fastsse".

Current processors that might benefit from this code are:

  AMD K10
  AMD Bulldozer/Piledriver/Steamroller/Excavator
  Intel Nocona
  Intel Nehalem/Westmere
  Intel Sandybridge/Ivybridge
  Intel Haswell/Broadwell
  VIA Nano

Current processors that do not benefit from this code are:

  AMD K8
  AMD Bobcat
  Intel Atom

Intel Conroe/Penryn is a border case; its handling of non-aligned
128-bit memory operands is poor.  VIA Nano also have poor handling of
non-aligned operands.
