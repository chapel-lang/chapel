// _SC_PAGESIZE is only for indicating the page size as used in calls to
// mmap(2).  POSIX does not demand that _SC_PAGESIZE is actually the
// physical page size.
//
// Two quotes from the Linux man pages:
//
//   $ man getpagesize
//   [...]
//    The  function  getpagesize()  returns  the  number of bytes in a page,
//    where a "page" is the thing used where it says in the  description  of
//    mmap(2) that files are mapped in page-sized units.
//
//    The size of the kind of pages that mmap uses, is found using
//
//        #include <unistd.h>
//        long sz = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);
//
//
//   $ man sysconf
//   [...]
//    These values also exist, but may not be standard.
//
//    - _SC_PHYS_PAGES
//       The number of pages of physical memory.  Note that it is possi-
//       ble   for   the   product  of  this  value  and  the  value  of
//       _SC_PAGE_SIZE to overflow.
//
//
// So, actually Ehren's application works on Linux just coincidentally,
// since it make invalid assumptions.
