#ifndef _chpl_mem_consistency_h_
#define _chpl_mem_consistency_h_

#include "chpl-atomics.h" // for memory_order

#include "chpl-cache.h" // for chpl_cache_release, chpl_cache_acquire

// These functions support memory consistency with the remote
// data cache. They do not need to do anything if the cache is
// not enabled.

// When do these fences need to be called?

// Release fence before doing a sync variable operation
// in case that sync variable operation triggers a remote
// task to read values we are supposed to have written.

// Acquire fence after doing a sync variable operation
// in case the sync variable indicated to us that it is
// now safe to read a remote value (that another task updated).

// When spawning a task (or 'on' clause), make sure that any pending
// writes have completed (so that when that task or 'on' clause
// does a 'get', the written value will be available).

// When joining with a task (or 'on' clause), make sure that
// any values written in that task will be reflected in the current
// task (so if the task changed a value, a subsequent 'get' will
// read the new value).

// When starting a task or 'on' clause, make sure that any cached
// values from before the task started (e.g. if a thread is reused)
// are not used again, since values written before the task started
// need to be available to 'get'.

// When completing a task or 'on' clause, make sure that any cached
// writes have completed, so that the acquire fence when joining with
// this task will allow the joined task to read values written by this
// task.
