/*
 Concurrent-safe memory reclamation using Quiescent State-Based Reclamation (QSBR).

 For memory to be appropriately protected by QSBR, two invariants must be established:
  1.  References to QSBR-protected memory obtained prior to a checkpoint must not be
      used after the checkpoint, otherwise the reference is unsafe.
  2.  QSBR-protected memory must only be deferred for deletion at most once.

 The idiomatic usage of QSBR involves separating memory reclamation into two phases:
  1.  Logically deleting memory by removing it from some data structure in some linearizable fashion.
  2.  Physically deleting the memory by deferring deletion of it.

 This is commonly the case for non-blocking data structures and algorithms. For an example, see below:

 ======================================
      Non-Blocking Stack
 ======================================
  struct node *head;

  void *dequeue(void) {
    struct node *currentHead, *newHead;
    // The currentHead is logically removed from the list...
    do {
      currentHead = load(&head);
      if (currentHead == NULL) return NULL;
      newHead = currentHead->next;
    } while (CAS(&head, currentHead, newHead));
    
    // Queue up for physical removal...
    void *ret = currentHead->value;
    chpl_qsbr_defer_delete(currentHead);
    return ret;
  }
