// NIC-registered memory management.
//
// The following functions manage a pool of memory that is guaranteed
// to be registered with the NIC.  Some NIC operations require that
// the referred-to memory be registered with the NIC, and some ugni
// comm layer functionality depends on such NIC operations.  As an
// example, when user code does a blocking executeOn (fork), the comm
// layer on the initiating node needs a "done" flag that the target
// node can PUT a value into to indicate that the remote executeOn has
// completed.  Gemini/Aries PUT operations require that the receiving
// address on the remote node be NIC-registered.  Thus the flag may
// reside on the initiator's call stack if that is NIC-registered, but
// if it isn't we need to allocate the flag dynamically.  We can't be
// sure that a heap allocation will always produce registered memory,
// so we get such flags through the functions here.
//
// Note that there is no free() function here.  We expect the usage
// model to be that callers acquire a block of memory for whatever use
// they have, and then manage dynamic allocation and deallocation out
// of that if they need to.  This vastly simplifies the mechanics of
// managing both the memory and the NIC registration.
//
