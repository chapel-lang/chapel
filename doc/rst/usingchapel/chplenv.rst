.. _readme-chplenv:

Setting up Your Environment for Chapel
======================================

To get started with Chapel, there are four environment settings that are
strongly recommended for effective use of the release, and a few other optional
settings that are useful for cross-compiling or overriding the default
settings.  To check the values of the Chapel environment variables that are set
or can be inferred, run the script::

  $CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv

The ``setchplenv.*`` source scripts in the ``$CHPL_HOME/util/quickstart/`` and
``$CHPL_HOME/util/`` directories contain commands that set the following
variables for various shells and host platforms when they are sourced from the
``$CHPL_HOME`` directory.  Frequent Chapel users may want to add such settings
to their shell's dotfile(s); but for getting started the setchplenv.* scripts
can be convenient.

Recommended Settings
--------------------

.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_HOME:

CHPL_HOME
~~~~~~~~~
   Set the ``CHPL_HOME`` environment variable to point to the location of the
   chapel/ directory that was created when you unpacked the release.
   For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        export CHPL_HOME=~/chapel-1.17.0

   .. note::
     This, and all other examples in the Chapel documentation, assumes you're
     using the ``bash`` shell.  If using ``csh`` or ``tcsh``, mentally change
     ``export FOO=BAR`` to ``setenv FOO BAR``.  If using some other shell, make
     the appropriate adjustment.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM:

CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Set the ``CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM`` environment variable to represent the platform on
   which you're working.  For standard UNIX workstations, this can be done by
   running the ``$CHPL_HOME/util/chplenv/chpl_platform.py`` script.  For
   example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        export CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM=`$CHPL_HOME/util/chplenv/chpl_platform.py`

   For other platforms that appear very similar to a UNIX workstation from the
   shell prompt (e.g., a Cray XK\ |trade|), the value may need to be set
   explicitly.  The strings for our currently-supported host platforms are as
   follows:

        ===========  ==================================
        Value        Description
        ===========  ==================================
        cygwin32     x86 Cygwin (Windows) platforms
        cygwin64     x86_64 Cygwin (Windows) platforms
        darwin       Macintosh OS X platforms
        linux32      32-bit Linux platforms
        linux64      64-bit Linux platforms
        marenostrum  BSC's MareNostrum platform
        netbsd32     32-bit NetBSD platforms
        netbsd64     64-bit NetBSD platforms
        pwr5         IBM Power5 SMP cluster
        pwr6         IBM Power6 SMP cluster
        sunos        SunOS platforms
        cray-cs      Cray CS\ |trade|
        cray-xc      Cray XC\ |trade|
        cray-xe      Cray XE\ |trade|
        cray-xk      Cray XK\ |trade|
        ===========  ==================================

   Platform-specific documentation is available for most of these platforms in
   :ref:`platforms-index`.

   The Chapel Makefiles and sources are designed to work for any UNIX-compatible
   environment that supports a GNU-compatible make utility.  The list above
   represents the set of platforms that we have access to and can test easily.
   We are interested in making our code framework portable to other platforms --
   if you are using Chapel on a platform other than the ones listed above,
   please refer to :ref:`platform-specific-settings` for ways to set up a
   Makefile for this platform and/or contact us at:
   :disguise:`chapel_info@cray.com`

PATH
~~~~
   Set your ``PATH`` to include the directory
   ``$CHPL_HOME/bin/$CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM`` which is created when you build the
   compiler.  For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        export PATH="$PATH":"$CHPL_HOME/bin/$CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM"


MANPATH
~~~~~~~
   Set your man path to include the directory ``$CHPL_HOME/man``.
   For example:

    .. code-block:: sh

        export MANPATH="$MANPATH":"$CHPL_HOME"/man

Optional Settings
-----------------

.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM:

CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   If you are cross-compiling for a platform other than your
   ``$CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM``, set the ``CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM`` environment
   variable to describe that platform.  See `CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM`_ above for
   legal values (though whether or not a given setting will support
   cross-compilation depends on your specific environment).

   .. note::
     If ``CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM`` is not set, the target platform defaults to the
     same value as ``$CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM``.

.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_COMPILER:

CHPL_*_COMPILER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, you can set ``CHPL_HOST_COMPILER`` and/or
   ``CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER`` to indicate the compiler suite to use in building
   the sources.  ``CHPL_HOST_COMPILER`` is the compiler used to build the
   Chapel compiler itself so that it will run on ``CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM``.
   ``CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER`` is the compiler used to build the runtime libraries
   and generated code for ``CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM``.  Currently supported values
   are as follows:

        =================  ===================================================
        Value              Description
        =================  ===================================================
        clang              The Clang compiler suite -- clang and clang++
        clang-included     The Clang compiler in third-party/llvm
        cray-prgenv-cray   The Cray PrgEnv compiler using the Cray CCE backend
        cray-prgenv-gnu    The Cray PrgEnv compiler using the GNU backend
        cray-prgenv-intel  The Cray PrgEnv compiler using the Intel backend
        cray-prgenv-pgi    The Cray PrgEnv compiler using the PGI backend
        gnu                The GNU compiler suite -- gcc and g++
        ibm                The IBM compiler suite -- xlc and xlC
        intel              The Intel compiler suite -- icc and icpc
        pgi                The PGI compiler suite -- pgcc and pgc++
        =================  ===================================================

   The default for ``CHPL_*_COMPILER`` depends on the value of the corresponding
   ``CHPL_*_PLATFORM`` environment variable:

        ============  ==================================================
        Platform      Compiler
        ============  ==================================================
        cray-x*       - gnu (for ``CHPL_HOST_COMPILER``)
                      - cray-prgenv-$PE_ENV (for ``CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER``,
                        where PE_ENV is set by PrgEnv-* modules)
        darwin        clang if available, otherwise gnu
        marenostrum   ibm
        pwr5, pwr6    ibm
        other         gnu
        ============  ==================================================

   If ``CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM == CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM`` and is not ``cray-x*``,
   ``CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER`` will default to the same value as ``CHPL_HOST_COMPILER``.

   .. note::
     Note that builds with :ref:`readme-llvm` (i.e. when ``CHPL_LLVM=llvm``)
     will build the runtime twice: once with the compiler as described above and
     once with clang-included. We do this in order to avoid issues in linking
     objects built by different compilers.

.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_TARGET_ARCH:

CHPL_TARGET_ARCH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, set the ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH`` environment variable to indicate
   that the target executable should be specialized to the given architecture
   when using ``--specialize`` (and ``--fast``). Valid options are:

        ========  =============================================================
        Value     Description
        ========  =============================================================
        native    The C compiler will attempt to detect the architecture on the
                  machine that is compiling the target executable. This is a
                  good choice if you will be running on the same machine that
                  you are compiling on.  If you are not, see the options below.
        unknown   No specialization will be performed
        none      No specialization will be performed (will not warn)
        ========  =============================================================

        **Architecture-specific values**

        =========== ================
        intel       amd
        =========== ================
        core2           k8
        nehalem         k8sse3
        westmere        barcelona
        sandybridge     bdver1
        ivybridge       bdver2
        haswell         bdver3
        broadwell       bdver4
        =========== ================

   These values are defined to be the same as in GCC 4.9:

        https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.9.0/gcc/i386-and-x86-64-Options.html

   If you do not want ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH`` to have any effect, you can set it
   to either ``unknown`` or ``none``. Both will disable specialization, but the
   latter will not warn if ``--specialize`` is used.

   Setting ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH`` to an incorrect value for your processor may
   result in an invalid binary that will not run on the intended machine.
   Special care should be taken to select the lowest common denominator when
   running on machines with heterogeneous processor architectures.

   The default value for this setting will vary based on settings in your
   environment, in order of application these rules are:

        * If :ref:`CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER <readme-chplenv.chpl_compiler>` is ``cray-prgenv-*`` you do not need to
          set anything in ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH``. One of the ``craype-*`` modules
          (e.g.  ``craype-sandybridge``) should be loaded to provide equivalent
          functionality. Once the proper module is loaded, ``CRAY_CPU_TARGET``
          will have the architecture being used in it.

        * If ``CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER`` is ``cray``, ``pgi``, or ``ibm``,
          ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH`` will be set to ``none`` and no specialization
          will occur.

        * If :ref:`readme-chplenv.CHPL_COMM` is set, no attempt to set a useful value will be
          made, ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH`` will be ``unknown``.

        * If :ref:`readme-chplenv.CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM` is ``darwin``, ``linux*``, or
          ``cygwin*`` ``CHPL_TARGET_ARCH`` will be ``native``, passing the
          responsibility off to the backend C compiler to detect the specifics
          of the hardware.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_MAKE:

CHPL_MAKE
~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, set the ``CHPL_MAKE`` environment variable to indicate the
   GNU-compatible make utility that you want the compiler back-end to invoke
   when compiling the generated C code.  If not set, this will default to a
   value based on ``$CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM``:

        ==================    ============
        platform              make utility
        ==================    ============
        cygwin*, darwin       make
        linux32, linux64      gmake if available, otherwise make
        other                 gmake
        ==================    ============


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_MODULE_PATH:

CHPL_MODULE_PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, set the ``CHPL_MODULE_PATH`` environment variable to provide a
   list of directories to be added to the :ref:`readme-module_search`.  The
   value of this environment variable should be a colon-separated list of
   directory paths.

   The module search path is used to satisfy 'use' statements in the Chapel
   program.  The complete search path can be displayed using the compiler option
   ``--print-search-dirs``.  It will also include the compiler's standard module
   search paths, those introduced by the ``-M`` flag on the command line and
   directories containing the .chpl files named explicitly on the compiler
   command line.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL:

CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, set the ``CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL`` environment variable to
   indicate the locale model you want to use.  Current options are:

        ======== =============================================
        Value    Description
        ======== =============================================
        flat     top-level locales are not further subdivided
        numa     top-level locales are further subdivided into
                 sublocales, each one a NUMA domain
        knl      a processor-specific locale model for the
                 self-hosted Xeon Phi (Knight's Landing) which
                 includes NUMA support and access to the
                 tightly-coupled high-bandwidth memory
        ======== =============================================

   If unset, ``CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL`` defaults to ``flat``.

   See :ref:`readme-localeModels` for more information about
   locale models.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_TASKS:

CHPL_TASKS
~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, set the ``CHPL_TASKS`` environment variable to indicate what
   tasking layer you want to use to implement intra-locale parallelism (see
   :ref:`readme-tasks` for more information on this option).  Current options
   are:

        ============== ===================================================
        Value          Description
        ============== ===================================================
        qthreads       use Sandia's Qthreads package
        fifo           use POSIX threads
        massivethreads use U Tokyo's MassiveThreads package
        ============== ===================================================

   If ``CHPL_TASKS`` is not set it defaults to ``qthreads`` in all cases
   except for a few specific configurations in which it defaults to
   ``fifo``:

     * target platform is ``cygwin*``
     * target platform is ``netbsd*``

   .. note::
     Note that the Chapel ``util/quickstart/setchplenv.*`` source scripts set
     ``CHPL_TASKS`` to ``fifo`` to reduce build-time and third-party dependences,
     while the ``util/setchplenv.*`` versions leave it unset, resulting in the
     behavior described just above.

   See :ref:`readme-tasks` for more information about executing using the
   various ``CHPL_TASKS`` options.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_COMM:

CHPL_COMM
~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, set the ``CHPL_COMM`` environment variable to indicate what
   communication layer you want to use to implement inter-locale communication.
   Current options are:

        ======= ============================================
        Value   Description
        ======= ============================================
        none    only supports single-locale execution
        gasnet  use the GASNet-based communication layer
        ugni    Cray-specific native communication layer
        ======= ============================================

   If unset, ``CHPL_COMM`` defaults to ``none`` in most cases.  On Cray XE
   and XC systems it defaults to ``ugni``.  On Cray CS systems it defaults
   to ``gasnet``.  See :ref:`readme-multilocale` for more information on
   executing Chapel programs using multiple locales.  See :ref:`readme-cray`
   for more information about Cray-specific runtime layers.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_MEM:

CHPL_MEM
~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_MEM`` environment variable can be used to select
   a memory management layer.  Current options are:

        ========= =======================================================
        Value     Description
        ========= =======================================================
        cstdlib   use the standard C malloc/free commands
        jemalloc  use Jason Evan's memory allocator
        ========= =======================================================

   If unset, ``CHPL_MEM`` defaults to ``jemalloc`` for most configurations.
   If the target platform is ``cygwin*`` it defaults to ``cstdlib``

   .. note::
     Certain ``CHPL_COMM`` settings (e.g. ugni and gasnet segment fast/large)
     register the heap to improve communication performance.  Registering the
     heap requires special allocator support that not all allocators provide.
     Currently only ``jemalloc`` is capable of supporting configurations that
     require a registered heap.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_LAUNCHER:

CHPL_LAUNCHER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_LAUNCHER`` environment variable can be used to select
   a launcher to get your program up and running.  See :ref:`readme-launcher`
   for more information on this variable's default and possible settings.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_ATOMICS:

CHPL_ATOMICS
~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_ATOMICS`` environment variable can be used to
   select an implementation for atomic operations in the runtime.  Current
   options are:

        ===========  =====================================================
        Value        Description
        ===========  =====================================================
        cstdlib      implement Chapel atomics as a wrapper around C
                     standard atomics (from C11)
        intrinsics   implement atomics using target compiler intrinsics
                     (which typically map down to hardware capabilities)
        locks        implement atomics by using Chapel sync variables to
                     protect normal operations
        ===========  =====================================================

   If unset, CHPL_ATOMICS defaults to ``intrinsics`` for most configurations.
   On some 32 bit platforms, or if the target compiler is ``pgi`` or
   ``cray-prgenv-pgi`` it defaults to ``locks``.  In a future release,
   ``cstdlib`` will become the default whenever possible.  At this
   time, though, most C compilers either do not support standard
   atomics or have bugs in their implementation.

   .. note::
     gcc 4.8.1 added support for 64 bit atomics on 32 bit platforms.  We
     default to ``intrinsics`` for 32 bit platforms when using the target
     compiler ``gnu`` with a recent enough version of gcc.  For older versions
     or other target compilers we default to ``locks``

   See the Chapel Language Specification for more information about atomic
   operations in Chapel or :ref:`readme-atomics` for more information about the
   runtime implementation.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_TIMERS:

CHPL_TIMERS
~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_TIMERS`` environment variable can be used to
   select an implementation for Chapel's timers.  Current options are:

       generic
         use a ``gettimeofday()``-based implementation

   If unset, ``CHPL_TIMERS`` defaults to ``generic``


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_GMP:

CHPL_GMP
~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_GMP`` environment variable can select between
   no GMP support, using the GMP distributed with Chapel in third-party, or
   using a system GMP. Current options are:

       =======  ============================================================
       Value     Description
       =======  ============================================================
       system   use a system install of GMP
                (#include gmp.h, -lgmp)
       none     do not build GMP support into the Chapel runtime
       gmp      use the GMP distribution bundled with Chapel in third-party
       =======  ============================================================

   If unset, Chapel will attempt to build GMP using
   :ref:`CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER<readme-chplenv.CHPL_COMPILER>` (noting that the bundled version
   may not be supported by all compilers).  Based on the outcome, Chapel will
   default to:

       ======= ====================================================
       Value   Description
       ======= ====================================================
       gmp     if the build was successful
       system  if unsuccessful and :ref:`readme-chplenv.CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM` is cray-x*
       none    otherwise
       ======= ====================================================

   .. note::
     Note that the Chapel ``util/quickstart/setchplenv.*`` source scripts set
     ``CHPL_GMP`` to ``none`` while the ``util/setchplenv.*`` versions leave it
     unset, resulting in the behavior described just above.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_HWLOC:

CHPL_HWLOC
~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_HWLOC`` environment variable can select between
   no hwloc support or using the hwloc package distributed with Chapel in
   third-party.

       ======== ==============================================================
       Value    Description
       ======== ==============================================================
       none     do not build hwloc support into the Chapel runtime
       hwloc    use the hwloc distribution bundled with Chapel in third-party
       ======== ==============================================================

   If unset, ``CHPL_HWLOC`` defaults to ``hwloc`` if
   :ref:`readme-chplenv.CHPL_TASKS` is ``qthreads``.  In all other cases
   it defaults to ``none``.  In the unlikely event the bundled hwloc
   distribution does not build successfully, it should still be possible
   to use qthreads.  To do this, manually set ``CHPL_HWLOC`` to ``none``
   and rebuild (and please file a bug with the Chapel team.) Note that
   building without hwloc will have a negative impact on performance.

   .. (comment) CHPL_HWLOC=system is also available but it is only
       intended to support packaging.
       Using CHPL_HWLOC=system is not regularly tested and may not work
       for you. Chapel depends on hwloc features that are not available in
       all versions. For best results, we recommend using the bundled hwloc
       if possible.

..  (comment) CHPL_JEMALLOC is not a user-facing feature

   .. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_JEMALLOC:

   CHPL_JEMALLOC
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      Optionally, the ``CHPL_JEMALLOC`` environment variable can select
      between no jemalloc, or using the jemalloc distributed with Chapel in
      third-party. This setting is intended to elaborate upon
      ``CHPL_MEM=jemalloc``.

          ======== ==============================================================
          Value    Description
          ======== ==============================================================
          none     do not build or use jemalloc
          jemalloc use the jemalloc distribution bundled with Chapel in third-party
          ======== ==============================================================

      If unset, ``CHPL_JEMALLOC`` defaults to ``jemalloc`` if
      :ref:`readme-chplenv.CHPL_MEM` is ``jemalloc``.  In all other cases it
      defaults to ``none``.

   .. (comment) CHPL_JEMALLOC=system is also available but it is only
       intended to support packaging.
       Using CHPL_JEMALLOC=system is not regularly tested and may not work
       for you. Chapel depends on jemalloc features that are not available in
       all versions. For best results, we recommend using the bundled jemalloc
       if possible.

.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_REGEXP:

CHPL_REGEXP
~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_REGEXP`` environment variable can be used to enable
   regular expression operations as defined in :chpl:mod:`Regexp`.  Current
   options are:

       ======= ==============================================
       Value   Description
       ======= ==============================================
       re2     use the re2 distribution in third-party
       none    do not support regular expression operations
       ======= ==============================================

   If unset, Chapel will attempt to build RE2 using :ref:`CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER<readme-chplenv.CHPL_COMPILER>`
   (noting that the bundled version may not be supported by all compilers).
   Based on the outcome, Chapel will default to:

       ======= ===============================
       Value   Description
       ======= ===============================
       re2     if the build was successful
       none    otherwise
       ======= ===============================

   .. note::
     Note that the Chapel ``util/quickstart/setchplenv.*`` source scripts set
     ``CHPL_REGEXP`` to ``'none`` while the ``util/setchplenv.*`` versions
     leave it unset, resulting in the behavior described just above.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_AUX_FILESYS:

CHPL_AUX_FILESYS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_AUX_FILESYS`` environment variable can be used to
   request that runtime support for filesystems beyond the usual Linux one be
   present.  Current options are:

       ====== =================================================
       Value  Description
       ====== =================================================
       none   only support traditional Linux filesystems
       hdfs   also support HDFS filesystems using Apache Hadoop libhdfs
       hdfs3  support for HDFS filesystems using Pivotal libhdfs3
       curl   also support CURL as a filesystem interface
       ====== =================================================

   If unset, ``CHPL_AUX_FILESYS`` defaults to ``none``.

   See :ref:`readme-auxIO`, :chpl:mod:`HDFS`, and :chpl:mod:`Curl` for more
   information about HDFS and CURL support.


.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_LLVM:

CHPL_LLVM
~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_LLVM`` environment variable can be used to
   enable support for the LLVM back-end to the Chapel compiler (see
   :ref:`readme-llvm`) or to support extern blocks in Chapel code via
   the Clang compiler (see :ref:`readme-extern`).  Current options are:

       ============== ======================================================
       Value          Description
       ============== ======================================================
       llvm           use the llvm/clang distribution in third-party
       system         find a compatible LLVM in system libraries;
                      note: the LLVM must be a version supported by Chapel
       none           do not support llvm-/clang-related features
       ============== ======================================================

   .. (comment) -minimal can be used but is only interesting for developers
       llvm-minimal   as above, but only build and link LLVM ADTs
       system-minimal as above, but only link LLVM ADTs

   If unset, ``CHPL_LLVM`` defaults to ``llvm`` if you've already installed
   llvm in third-party and ``none`` otherwise.

   Chapel currently supports LLVM 6.0.  Earlier versions of LLVM
   required the use of internal Clang header files.  LLVM 5.0 has a
   known optimization bug that affects Chapel.

   .. note::

       We have had success with this procedure to install LLVM 6.0
       dependencies on Ubuntu.

       First, place the appropriate lines from ``https://apt.llvm.org``
       into ``/etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm-toolchain.list``, then do
       the following.

        .. code-block:: sh

            apt-get install llvm-6.0-dev llvm-6.0 llvm-6.0-tools clang-6.0 libclang-6.0-dev libedit-dev

.. _readme-chplenv.CHPL_UNWIND:

CHPL_UNWIND
~~~~~~~~~~~
   Optionally, the ``CHPL_UNWIND`` environment variable can be used to select
   an unwind library for stack tracing. Current options are:

       ========= =======================================================
       Value     Description
       ========= =======================================================
       libunwind use the libunwind bundled with Chapel in third-party
       system    assume libunwind is already installed on the system
       none      don't use an unwind library, disabling stack tracing
       ========= =======================================================

   If unset, ``CHPL_UNWIND`` defaults to ``none``

Compiler Command Line Option Defaults
-------------------------------------

Most of the compiler's command line options support setting a default value for
the option via an environment variable.  To see a list of the environment
variables that support each option, run the compiler with the ``--help-env``
flag.  For boolean flags and toggles, setting the environment variable to any
value selects that flag.

.. _readme-chplenv.chplconfig:

Chapel Configuration File
-------------------------

The Chapel configuration file is a file named either ``chplconfig`` or
``.chplconfig`` that can store overrides of the inferred environment variables
listed as a result of executing ``printchplenv``.

Syntax
~~~~~~

Below are the valid forms of syntax for Chapel configuration files. All other
usages will result in a syntax error.

**Definitions**

Users can define variables with the following format:

.. code-block:: python

    CHPL_ENV=value


Above, the default value of ``CHPL_ENV`` will be overridden to be ``value``.
All white space is stripped away from definitions.

**Ignored Lines**

Any lines containing nothing or only white space will be ignored.  Comments,
which are denoted by the ``#`` character, similar to ``bash`` or ``python``,
are also ignored.


Example
~~~~~~~

Below is an example of a Chapel configuration file with comments:

.. code-block:: python

    # ~/.chplconfig

    # Default to multi-locale
    CHPL_COMM=gasnet

    CHPL_TASKS=qthreads # Use Qthreads

    # System GMP is available on these machines
    CHPL_GMP=system


To confirm the configuration file is written correctly, you can run
``printchplenv --all --overrides``, which will show a list of variables that are
currently being overridden. Values followed by a
``+`` have been overridden by the Chapel configuration file, whereas
values followed by a ``*`` have been overridden by an environment variable.

Generating Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


To generate a configuration file based on the current configuration, use
``printchplenv`` or ``./configure``.

When using ``printchplenv``, run it with the ``--simple`` format flag to get a
format compatible with Chapel configuration files.

The ``--overrides`` filter flag can be used to print only the variables
currently overridden by either environment variables or Chapel
configuration file.

For example, to save the current overrides into a Chapel configuration file:

.. code-block:: sh

    printchplenv --all --simple --overrides > ~/.chplconfig

The ``printchplenv --all --simple`` flag can be used to print all the variables
of the current configuration. For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    printchplenv --all --simple > ~/.chplconfig

For more information on using ``printchplenv``, see the ``printchplenv -h``
output.

Alternatively, the ``./configure`` script will generate a ``chplconfig``
file. See :ref:`readme-installing`.


Search Paths and File Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Though you can put your Chapel configuration file anywhere by setting the
``$CHPL_CONFIG`` environment variable to its enclosing directory, you can also
place it in your ``$HOME`` or ``$CHPL_HOME`` directory and Chapel will be able to
find it.

The search priority for Chapel configuration files is as follows:

1. ``$CHPL_CONFIG``
2. ``$HOME`` (``~/``)
3. ``$CHPL_HOME``

When both a ``chplconfig`` and ``.chplconfig`` are present, the visible
``chplconfig`` will be prioritized.

Only a single ``chplconfig`` file will be used. That is, as soon as a valid
Chapel configuration file is found, the definitions of that file are used.

.. note::

    The ``$CHPL_CONFIG`` variable is the path to the *enclosing*
    directory - not the full path including ``chplconfig`` itself.

Variable Priority
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Variable precedence goes in the following order:

1. Explicit compiler flags: ``chpl --env=value``
2. Environment variables: ``CHPL_ENV=value``
3. Chapel configuration file: ``~/.chplconfig``
4. Inferred environment variables: ``printchplenv``
