Mason Packages
==============

Community-developed modules are available as mason packages on the
`mason registry repository <https://github.com/chapel-lang/mason-registry/>`_.
These packages can be downloaded and used through :ref:`mason <readme-mason>`,
Chapel's package manager.

Browsing available packages is best done through the ``mason`` command line
tool, via ``mason search``. They can also be found by browsing the mason
registry repository.

For details on contributing a package to the mason registry, see the
documentation on :ref:`submitting a package <submit-a-package>`.

.. note::

    The process of publishing mason packages is still under development. As a
    result, the current process still has some rough edges, but is expected to
    improve over time.
