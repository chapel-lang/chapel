Locale Models
=============

------------
Introduction
------------

Chapel's original computer system architecture model was a collection of
simple locales connected by a communication network.  The locales had
one or more homogeneous processor cores and one kind of memory, with all
the memory equidistant from all the processor cores.  But while this
model was conceptually easy to deal with, it couldn't support users who
wanted to take advantage of modern node architectures.  To support
these, we are extending architectural descriptions.  In the new model
the top level may still be a network of locales, but the locales are
more complicated.  They may be internally heterogeneous, containing
multiple instances of memories and/or processors with differing
characteristics.  They may also be hierarchical, with parent locales
containing one or more child sublocales within them.

There are currently three locale models available, flat, NUMA, and KNL.  The
flat model is the default and maps closely to the view of locales
implemented in the 1.7 release.  The NUMA locale model maps sublocales
to NUMA domains.  The NUMA model is currently implemented at a prototype
level. Performance has not yet been a focus in the NUMA locale model and
will require additional effort in future releases.  The KNL locale
model provides support for self-hosting Xeon Phi (formerly Knight's
Landing) processors and includes provision for access to
tightly-coupled on-package high-bandwidth DRAM memory.  We expect to
add more locale models in future releases.


-----------------------------------
Architecture support in the modules
-----------------------------------

The code emitted by the compiler contains calls to support routines that
manage memory, communication, and tasking, among other things.  Before
hierarchical locale support was added, these calls were all satisfied
directly by the runtime.  With hierarchical locales, now they are
satisfied by the Chapel module code that defines the architecture of a
locale.  The required interface for this is defined by ChapelLocale and
implemented by ``LocaleModel.chpl``.  The required interface is still a work
in progress and will continue to evolve.


-----------------
Flat Locale Model
-----------------

The current default locale model is the flat locale model. In the flat model,
locales have homogeneous processor cores and all cores are equidistant from
memory.


.. _readme-NUMAlm:

-----------------
NUMA Locale Model
-----------------

In the NUMA locale model, the processor is split into NUMA domains
and cores within a domain have faster access to local memory.

The NUMA locale model is supported most fully when qthreads tasking is
used.  While other tasking layers are also functionally correct using
the NUMA locale model, they are not NUMA aware.  In addition, the
Portable Hardware Locality library (hwloc) is used with qthreads to map
sublocales to NUMA domains. For more information about qthreads and
about tuning parameters such as the number of qthread shepherds per
locale, please see :ref:`readme-tasks`.

To use the NUMA locale model:

1) Set the ``CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL`` environment variable to ``numa``.

.. code-block:: sh

    export CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL=numa

2) Re-make the compiler and runtime from ``CHPL_HOME``

.. code-block:: sh

    cd $CHPL_HOME
    make

3) Compile your Chapel program as usual.

.. code-block:: sh

    chpl -o jacobi $CHPL_HOME/examples/programs/jacobi.chpl

Performance Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Performance when using the NUMA locale model is currently somewhat
hit-or-miss.

Development in the 1.15 release improved array data locality in the NUMA
locale model by adding the ability to split array data storage into
blocks and distribute those blocks across NUMA domains.  Based on the
internal term for array data storage, such arrays are called
*multi-ddata* arrays.  Although only large arrays (2 MiB or more) can
have multiple data blocks, the array addressing code to support them is
always present when the NUMA locale model is used.  This code has turned
out to cause large performance degradations in some cases, but it has
also improved performance quite a bit in others.

On the downside, array indexing in the NUMA locale model in 1.15 is much
slower when the program iterates over an array's domain or the domain's
range, as the first two cases below.  However, if the program iterates
over array elements themselves as in the last case below, then
performance is roughly the same as in previous releases:

.. code-block:: chapel

    var R = 0..n;
    var D = {R};
    var A: [D] int;

    forall i in D do ... A[i] ...; // slower than 1.14
    forall i in R do ... A[i] ...; // slower than 1.14
    forall a in A do ... a ...;    // same or better performance as 1.14

Whether the iteration is zippered or not is largely immaterial with
respect to these performance changes.  In particular, zippered iteration
over multiple arrays performs well, but if even one component of the
zippered iterator is a domain or range instead of an array then the
performance will be poor.  Finally, serial iteration has slowed down in
even more cases than has parallel iteration, with the exception that
serial iteration over a 1-dimensional array (as opposed to its domain or
range) remains as fast in 1.15 as it was in 1.14.

Counteracting this to some extent, on Cray XE and XC systems with
``CHPL_COMM=ugni`` and a hugepage-resident heap, the heap itself and any
multi-ddata array will have proper NUMA locality, potentially improving
performance.  As an example, as of 1.15, on a Cray XC system, the
stream-ep benchmark with the NUMA locale model and ``CHPL_COMM=ugni``
sped up by over 2x and is now at performance parity with the reference
version.

Over the course of the next release we expect to refine the NUMA locale
model implementation and resolve the array access problems that are
causing the poor performance in the NUMA locale model.


.. _readme-KNLlm:

----------------
KNL Locale Model
----------------

The KNL locale model has the same properties as the NUMA locale model,
plus it allows access to the Xeon Phi processor's on-package
high-bandwidth memory.

The KNL locale model requires the Intel Memkind library, which can be
obtained in source form, and is also available in the binary
repositories of some Linux distributions.

For more information on the Memkind library, please see:

    https://memkind.github.io

On a Cray system, Memkind can be loaded with the following command.
Note that this makes dynamic linking the default, because Memkind is
dynamically linked.

.. code-block:: sh

    module load cray-memkind

Once the Memkind library is available, Chapel can be built using the
instructions under :ref:`readme-NUMAlm`, except that
``CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL`` must be set to ``knl``.

On a Cray system, the KNL locale model is included in the Chapel
module, so the following commands are sufficient.

.. code-block:: sh

    module load cray-memkind
    module load chapel
    export CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL=knl

Please see :ref:`readme-cray` for more detailed information.

New locale model member functions are provided for controlling which
kind of memory is used for new allocations.  To allocate in high
bandwidth memory, use the ``.highBandwidthMemory()`` member function.
For example:

.. code-block:: sh

    on here.highBandwidthMemory() {
      x = new MyObject();
    }

It is also possible to say "Use the same locale as variable ``y``, but
use high bandwidth memory" as follows.

.. code-block:: sh

    on y.locale.highBandwidthMemory() {
      // . . .
    }

In case one is nested inside ``on`` statements and desires to get back
to the default externally-attached memory, a ``.defaultMemory()``
member function is available.

.. code-block:: sh

    on x {
      // . . .
      on here.defaultMemory() {
        // . . .
      }
    }

In addition, ``.lowLatencyMemory()`` and ``.largeMemory()`` functions
are provided for explicitly referencing the externally-attached
memory.  In the KNL locale model, ``.defaultMemory()``,
``.lowLatencyMemory()``, and ``.largeMemory()`` are all the same.

If the KNL processor is booted in the ``cache`` configuration, where
high-bandwidth memory is not exposed to the user, then the program
will still run and ``.highBandwidthMemory()`` will use the default
externally-attached memory.

The four memory selection functions have also been added to the flat
and NUMA locale models, so it is possible to write programs that take
advantage of the KNL processor when it is present, and yet still run
on other processors.

Please see :ref:`readme-knl` for additional information.


--------------------------
Qthreads thread scheduling
--------------------------

When qthreads tasking is used, different Qthreads thread schedulers are
selected depending upon the ``CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL`` setting.  For the flat
locale model the "nemesis" thread scheduler is used, and for the NUMA and KNL
locale models the "distrib" thread scheduler is used.  This selection is
done at the time the Qthreads third-party package is built, and cannot
be adjusted later, either at user compile time or at execution time.


---------------------------------------
Caveats for using the NUMA locale model
---------------------------------------

* Explicit memory allocation for NUMA domains is not yet implemented.

* Distributed arrays other than Block do not yet map iterations to NUMA
  domains.

* Performance for NUMA has not been optimized.
