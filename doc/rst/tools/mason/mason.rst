Overview
--------

This guide on Mason Packages contains everything that you need to
know to hit the ground developing in Chapel using mason, whether
that be to create a library to contribute to the community, use an
existing package, or just to help with the process of building your
Chapel programs.

.. note::

   **Pardon Our Dust**

   This mason guide is a work-in-progress as mason development itself
   is still a work-in-progress.  If you're not already using the `main
   branch <https://chapel-lang.org/docs/main/mason-packages/>`_ of the
   documentation (which tracks real-time GitHub development), you may
   find that it contains a more complete set of sections.  We welcome
   feedback and requests on the guide as we go.


The Chapel Users Guide is divided into four main sections:


Getting Started with Mason
