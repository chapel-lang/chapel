Using Chapel on Cygwin
======================

Chapel can be used on both 32-bit and 64-bit installations of Cygwin.
Chapel can be sensitive to directories with spaces, but otherwise it
will work on Cygwin just like any other platform.


Unpacking Chapel
----------------

For best results, avoid using WinZip to unpack the release, or make
sure that it is running in a mode that will not convert textfiles to
use Windows-style carriage-return/linefeed end-of-lines -- doing so
can change Makefiles such that they break the build process. We
recommend using Cygwin's gunzip and tar utilities to unpack the
release::

    gunzip chapel.tar.gz
    tar xvf chapel.tar

It is best to unpack the release in a directory whose path contains no
spaces. For example, unpacking the release in the root directory of your
hard-drive (``/cygdrive/c/``) to create ``/cygdrive/c/chapel`` tends to
work well. Currently, our compiler-generated Makefiles break when the
compiler or runtime use an absolute path that contains spaces. If any
Cygwin experts have tips on addressing this issue in a portable way,
please let us know at :disguise:`chapel_info@cray.com`.


Required Packages
-----------------

In order to get the required tools listed in :ref:`readme-prereqs`,
Cygwin users will need to ensure that the following packages are
installed in addition to the standard set of Cygwin packages:

    Devel
      + gcc and gcc-g++
      + make
    Perl
      + perl
    Python
      + python
    Utils
      + diffutils
