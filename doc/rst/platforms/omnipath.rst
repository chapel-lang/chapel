===========================
Using Chapel with Omni-Path 
===========================

This document describes how to run Chapel across multiple nodes of
an Intel Omni-Path cluster. :ref:`readme-multilocale` describes
general information about running Chapel in a multilocale
configuration.

.. warning::
    GASNet's ofi (libfabric) conduit is used to target Omni-Path.
    This conduit is technically experimental, but has been stable in
    our own testing.

    Note that ``CHPL_COMM=ofi`` is not supported for Omni-Path

-------------------------
Configuring for Omni-Path
-------------------------

To build Chapel with Omni-Path support, set:

.. code-block:: bash

      export CHPL_COMM=gasnet
      export CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=ofi

GASNet should automatically detect the ``psm2`` provider, but to
ensure this provider is used ``FI_PROVIDER=psm2`` may optionally be
set.

----------------------
Configuring a Launcher
----------------------

A ``gasnetrun_ofi``-based launcher should be used to launch jobs and
native launchers like ``srun`` will not work. Many Omni-Path
clusters use a workload manager or queueing system such as Slurm. To
select an appropriate Chapel launcher you can set ``CHPL_LAUNCHER``
to one of the following values:

===================  ======================================
Launcher Name        Description
===================  ======================================
gasnetrun_ofi         run jobs interactively on your system
slurm-gasnetrun_ofi   queue jobs using Slurm (srun/sbatch)
===================  ======================================

.. _setting-ofi-spawner:

-------------------
Selecting a Spawner
-------------------

Under the covers ``gasnetrun_ofi``-based launchers must figure out
how to spawn jobs and get them up and running on the compute nodes.
GASNet's two primary means of doing this on Omni-Path clusters are
``ssh`` and ``mpi``. GASNet will default to ``mpi`` if MPI support
is detected at configure time, otherwise it will default to ``ssh``.
Using ``mpi`` will likely incur a performance penalty because MPI
will be running concurrently with GASNet. Running with ``ssh`` is
recommended, but not all systems support ssh'ing to compute nodes so
it is not always the default.


Using SSH for Job Launch
------------------------

To launch Omni-Path jobs with SSH, use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Specify ssh spawner
   export GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER=ssh

   # Specify the nodes to run on (only required when using plain
   # gasnetrun_ofi outside a Slurm reservation)
   export GASNET_SSH_SERVERS="nid00001 nid00002 nid00003 ..."

If you receive an error message like:

.. code-block:: printoutput

      *** Failed to start processes on nid00001, possibly due to an inability to establish an ssh connection from login-node without interactive authentication.

This indicates passwordless SSH is not set up. You can try copying
existing SSH keys or generating new ones with the following:

.. code-block:: bash

      ssh-keygen -t rsa # use default location and empty passphrase
      cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

If you see the same error message this may indicate ssh connections
to compute nodes are not allowed, in which case using the MPI
spawner may be your only option.


Using MPI for Job Launch
------------------------

To launch Omni-Path jobs with *mpirun*, first make sure that *mpicc* is
available and that MPI programs launch appropriately with *mpirun*. Then use
the following. You'll want to make sure that GASNet detects MPI in its
configuration output.

.. code-block:: bash

   export GASNET_OFI_SPAWNER=mpi

It's worth noting that some configurations do not allow opening the
network device multiple times from a single process, so this method
may not be reliable.


--------------------
Verifying Job Launch
--------------------

Once the above configuration has been done, checking that jobs are
launching properly is recommended. The following Chapel program will
print out the locale names and how much parallelism is available per
locale. Ideally each locale is running on a unique node (not
oversubscribed) and the amount of parallelism matches the number of
physical cores on each node.

.. code-block:: chapel

      for loc in Locales do on loc do
        writeln((here.name, here.maxTaskPar));

An example run may look something like the following:

.. code-block:: printoutput

      (nid00001, 28)
      (nid00002, 28)

If nodes are oversubscribed or the amount of parallelism is far less
than expected see :ref:`setting-ofi-spawner` and if that does not
help consider opening a bug as described in :ref:`readme-bugs`.

In some cases, we have found that setting ``HFI_NO_CPUAFFINITY=1``
may be required to get access to all cores.
