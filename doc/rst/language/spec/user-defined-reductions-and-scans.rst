User-Defined Reductions and Scans
=================================

User-defined reductions and scans are supported via class definitions
where the class implements a structural interface. The definition of
this structural interface is forthcoming. The following paper sketched
out such an interface:

   S. J. Deitz, D. Callahan, B. L. Chamberlain, and L. Snyder.
   **Global-view abstractions for user-defined reductions and scans**.
   In *Proceedings of the Eleventh ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles
   and Practice of Parallel Programming*, 2006.
