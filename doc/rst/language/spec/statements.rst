Statements
==========

Chapel is an imperative language with statements that may have side
effects. Statements allow for the sequencing of program execution.
Chapel provides the following statements:



.. code-block:: syntax

   statement:
     block-statement
     expression-statement
     assignment-statement
     swap-statement
     io-statement
     conditional-statement
     select-statement
     while-do-statement
     do-while-statement
     for-statement
     label-statement
     break-statement
     continue-statement
     param-for-statement
     use-statement
     import-statement

.. _Blocks:

Blocks
------

A block is a statement or a possibly empty list of statements that form
their own scope. A block is given by 

.. code-block:: syntax

   block-statement:
     { statements[OPT] }

   statements:
     statement
     statement statements

Variables defined within a block are local
variables (:ref:`Local_Variables`).

The statements within a block are executed serially unless the block is
in a cobegin statement (:ref:`Cobegin`).

.. _Expression_Statements:

Expression Statements
---------------------

The expression statement evaluates an expression solely for side
effects. The syntax for an expression statement is given by 

.. code-block:: syntax

   expression-statement:
     variable-expression ;
     member-access-expression ;
     call-expression ;
     new-expression ;
     let-expression ;

.. _Assignment_Statements:

Assignment Statements
---------------------

An assignment statement assigns the value of an expression to another
expression, for example, a variable. Assignment statements are given by



.. code-block:: syntax

   assignment-statement:
     lvalue-expression assignment-operator expression

   assignment-operator: one of
      = += -= *= /= %= **= &= |= ^= &&= ||= <<= >>=

The assignment operators that contain a binary operator symbol as a
prefix are *compound assignment* operators. The remaining assignment
operator ``=`` is called *simple assignment*.

The expression on the left-hand side of the assignment operator must be
a valid lvalue (:ref:`LValue_Expressions`). It is evaluated
before the expression on the right-hand side of the assignment operator,
which can be any expression.

When the left-hand side is of a numerical type, there is an implicit
conversion (:ref:`Implicit_Conversions`) of the right-hand side
expression to the type of the left-hand side expression. Additionally,
for simple assignment, if the left-hand side is of Boolean type, the
right-hand side is implicitly converted to the type of the left-hand
side (i.e. a ``bool(?w)`` with the same width ``w``).

For simple assignment, the validity and semantics of assigning between
classes (:ref:`Class_Assignment`),
records (:ref:`Record_Assignment`),
unions (:ref:`Union_Assignment`),
tuples (:ref:`Tuple_Assignment`),
ranges (:ref:`Range_Assignment`),
domains (:ref:`Domain_Assignment`), and
arrays (:ref:`Array_Assignment`) are discussed in these later
sections.

A compound assignment is shorthand for applying the binary operator to
the left- and right-hand side expressions and then assigning the result
to the left-hand side expression. For numerical types, the left-hand
side expression is evaluated only once, and there is an implicit
conversion of the result of the binary operator to the type of the
left-hand side expression. Thus, for example, ``x += y`` is equivalent
to ``x = x + y`` where the expression ``x`` is evaluated once.

For all other compound assignments, Chapel provides a completely generic
catch-all implementation defined in the obvious way. For example:



.. code-block:: chapel

   inline proc +=(ref lhs, rhs) {
     lhs = lhs + rhs;
   }

Thus, compound assignment can be used with operands of arbitrary types,
provided that the following provisions are met: If the type of the
left-hand argument of a compound assignment operator ``op=`` is
:math:`L` and that of the right-hand argument is :math:`R`, then a
definition for the corresponding binary operator ``op`` exists, such
that :math:`L` is coercible to the type of its left-hand formal and
:math:`R` is coercible to the type of its right-hand formal. Further,
the result of ``op`` must be coercible to :math:`L`, and there must
exist a definition for simple assignment between objects of type
:math:`L`.

Both simple and compound assignment operators can be overloaded for
different types using operator
overloading (:ref:`Function_Overloading`). In such an overload,
the left-hand side expression should have ``ref`` intent and be modified
within the body of the function. The return type of the function should
be ``void``.

.. _The_Swap_Statement:

The Swap Statement
------------------

The swap statement indicates to swap the values in the expressions on
either side of the swap operator. Since both expressions are assigned
to, each must be a valid lvalue
expression (:ref:`LValue_Expressions`).

The swap operator can be overloaded for different types using operator
overloading (:ref:`Function_Overloading`). 

.. code-block:: syntax

   swap-statement:
     lvalue-expression swap-operator lvalue-expression

   swap-operator:
     <=>

To implement the swap operation, the compiler uses temporary variables
as necessary.

   *Example*.

   When resolved to the default swap operator, the following swap
   statement 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      var a, b: real;

      a <=> b;

   is semantically equivalent to: 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      const t = b;
      b = a;
      a = t;

.. _The_IO_Statement:

The I/O Statement
-----------------

The I/O operator indicates writing to the left-hand-side the value in
the right-hand-side; or reading from the left-hand-side and storing the
result in the variable on the right-hand-side. This operator can be
chained with other I/O operator calls.

The I/O operator can be overloaded for different types using operator
overloading (:ref:`Function_Overloading`). 

.. code-block:: syntax

   io-statement:
     io-expression io-operator expression

   io-expression:
     expression
     io-expression io-operator expression

   io-operator:
     <~>

See the module documentation on I/O for details on how to use the I/O
statement.

   *Example*.

   In the example below, 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      var w = opentmp().writer(); // a channel
      var a: real;
      var b: int;

      w <~> a <~> b;

   the I/O operator is left-associative and indicates writing ``a`` and
   then ``b`` to ``w`` in this case.

.. _The_Conditional_Statement:

The Conditional Statement
-------------------------

The conditional statement allows execution to choose between two
statements based on the evaluation of an expression of ``bool`` type.
The syntax for a conditional statement is given by 

.. code-block:: syntax

   conditional-statement:
     'if' expression 'then' statement else-part[OPT]
     'if' expression block-statement else-part[OPT]
     'if' ctrl-decl 'then' statement else-part[OPT]
     'if' ctrl-decl block-statement else-part[OPT]

   else-part:
     'else' statement

   ctrl-decl:
     'var' identifier '=' expression
     'const' identifier '=' expression

A conditional statement evaluates an expression of bool type. If the
expression evaluates to true, the first statement in the conditional
statement is executed. If the expression evaluates to false and the
optional else-clause exists, the statement following the ``else``
keyword is executed.

If the expression is a parameter, the conditional statement is folded by
the compiler. If the expression evaluates to true, the first statement
replaces the conditional statement. If the expression evaluates to
false, the second statement, if it exists, replaces the conditional
statement; if the second statement does not exist, the conditional
statement is removed.

Each statement embedded in the *conditional-statement* has its own scope
whether or not an explicit block surrounds it.

The control-flow declaration *ctrl-decl*, when used, declares a variable
whose scope is the then-clause of the conditional statement.
The expression must be of a class type. 
If it evaluates to ``nil``, the else-clause is executed if present. Otherwise 
its value is stored in the declared variable and the then-clause is executed.
If the expression's type is ``borrowed`` or  ``unmanaged``,
the variable's type is its non-nilable variant (:ref:`Nilable_Classes`).
Otherwise the variable stores a borrow of the expression's value
(:ref:`Class_Lifetime_and_Borrows`), and its type is the non-nilable
``borrowed`` counterpart of the expression's type.
The variable can be modified within the then-clause if it is declared
with the ``var`` keyword.

If the statement that immediately follows the optional ``then`` keyword
is a conditional statement and it is not in a block, the else-clause is
bound to the nearest preceding conditional statement without an
else-clause. The statement in the else-clause can be a conditional
statement, too.

   *Example (conditionals.chpl)*.

   The following function prints ``two`` when ``x`` is ``2`` and
   ``B,four`` when ``x`` is ``4``. 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      proc condtest(x:int) {
        if x > 3 then
          if x > 5 then
            write("A,");
          else
            write("B,");

        if x == 2 then
          writeln("two");
        else if x == 4 then
          writeln("four");
        else
          writeln("other");
      }

   

   .. BLOCK-test-chapelpost

      for i in 2..6 do condtest(i);

   

   .. BLOCK-test-chapeloutput

      two
      other
      B,four
      B,other
      A,other

.. _The_Select_Statement:

The Select Statement
--------------------

The select statement is a multi-way variant of the conditional
statement. The syntax is given by: 

.. code-block:: syntax

   select-statement:
     'select' expression { when-statements }

   when-statements:
     when-statement
     when-statement when-statements

   when-statement:
     'when' expression-list 'do' statement
     'when' expression-list block-statement
     'otherwise' statement
     'otherwise' 'do' statement

   expression-list:
     expression
     expression , expression-list

The expression that follows the keyword ``select``, the select
expression, is evaluated once and its value is then compared with the
list of case expressions following each ``when`` keyword. These values
are compared using the equality operator ``==``. If the expressions
cannot be compared with the equality operator, a compile-time error is
generated. The first case expression that contains an expression where
that comparison is ``true`` will be selected and control transferred to
the associated statement. If the comparison is always ``false``, the
statement associated with the keyword ``otherwise``, if it exists, will
be selected and control transferred to it. There may be at most one
``otherwise`` statement and its location within the select statement
does not matter.

Each statement embedded in the *when-statement* or the
*otherwise-statement* has its own scope whether or not an explicit block
surrounds it.

.. _The_While_and_Do_While_Loops:

The While Do and Do While Loops
-------------------------------

There are two variants of the while loop in Chapel. The syntax of the
while-do loop is given by: 

.. code-block:: syntax

   while-do-statement:
     'while' expression 'do' statement
     'while' expression block-statement
     'while' ctrl-decl 'do' statement
     'while' ctrl-decl block-statement

The syntax of the do-while loop is given by: 

.. code-block:: syntax

   do-while-statement:
     'do' statement 'while' expression ;

In both variants, the expression evaluates to a value of type ``bool``
which determines when the loop terminates and control continues with the
statement following the loop.

The while-do loop is executed as follows:

#. The expression is evaluated.

#. If the expression evaluates to ``false``, the statement is not
   executed and control continues to the statement following the loop.

#. If the expression evaluates to ``true``, the statement is executed
   and control continues to step 1, evaluating the expression again.

The do-while loop is executed as follows:

#. The statement is executed.

#. The expression is evaluated.

#. If the expression evaluates to ``false``, control continues to the
   statement following the loop.

#. If the expression evaluates to ``true``, control continues to step 1
   and the the statement is executed again.

In this second form of the loop, note that the statement is executed
unconditionally the first time.

   *Example (while.chpl)*.

   The following example illustrates the difference between the
   ``do-while-statement`` and the ``while-do-statement``. The body of
   the do-while loop is always executed at least once, even if the loop
   conditional is already false when it is entered. The code
   

   .. code-block:: chapel

      var t = 11;

      writeln("Scope of do while loop:");
      do {
        t += 1;
        writeln(t);
      } while (t <= 10);

      t = 11;
      writeln("Scope of while loop:");
      while (t <= 10) {
        t += 1;
        writeln(t);
      }

   produces the output 

   .. code-block:: printoutput

      Scope of do while loop:
      12
      Scope of while loop:

Chapel do-while loops differ from those found in most other languages in
one important regard. If the body of a do-while statement is a block
statement and new variables are defined within that block statement,
then the scope of those variables extends to cover the loop’s
termination expression.

   *Example (do-while.chpl)*.

   The following example demonstrates that the scope of the variable t
   includes the loop termination expression. 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      var i = 0;
      do {
        var t = i;
        i += 1;
        writeln(t);
      } while (t != 5);

   produces the output 

   .. code-block:: printoutput

      0
      1
      2
      3
      4
      5

The control-flow declaration *ctrl-decl*, when used in a while-do loop,
works similarly to how it does in a conditional statement
(:ref:`The_Conditional_Statement`).
It declares a variable whose scope is the loop body.
Its *expression* must be of a class type.
If it evaluates to ``nil``, the loop exits. Otherwise
its value is stored in the declared variable, the loop body is executed,
and the control returns to evaluating the expression again.
If the expression's type is ``borrowed`` or  ``unmanaged``,
the variable's type is its non-nilable variant (:ref:`Nilable_Classes`).
Otherwise the variable stores a borrow of the expression's value
(:ref:`Class_Lifetime_and_Borrows`), and its type is the non-nilable
``borrowed`` counterpart of the expression's type.
The variable can be modified within the loop body if it is declared
with the ``var`` keyword.

.. _The_For_Loop:

The For Loop
------------

The for loop iterates over ranges, domains, arrays, iterators, or any
class that implements an iterator named ``these``. The syntax of the for
loop is given by: 

.. code-block:: syntax

   for-statement:
     'for' index-var-declaration 'in' iteratable-expression 'do' statement
     'for' index-var-declaration 'in' iteratable-expression block-statement
     'for' iteratable-expression 'do' statement
     'for' iteratable-expression block-statement

   index-var-declaration:
     identifier
     tuple-grouped-identifier-list

   iteratable-expression:
     expression
     'zip' ( expression-list )

The ``index-var-declaration`` declares new variables for the scope of
the loop. It may specify a new identifier or may specify multiple
identifiers grouped using a tuple notation in order to destructure the
values returned by the iterator expression, as described
in :ref:`Indices_in_a_Tuple`.

The ``index-var-declaration`` is optional and may be omitted if the
indices do not need to be referenced in the loop.

If the iteratable-expression begins with the keyword ``zip`` followed by
a parenthesized expression-list, the listed expressions must support
zipper iteration.

.. _Zipper_Iteration:

Zipper Iteration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When multiple iterators are iterated over in a zipper context, on each
iteration, each expression is iterated over, the values are returned by
the iterators in a tuple and assigned to the index, and then statement
is executed.

The shape of each iterator, the rank and the extents in each dimension,
must be identical.

   *Example (zipper.chpl)*.

   The output of 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      for (i, j) in zip(1..3, 4..6) do
        write(i, " ", j, " ");

   

   .. BLOCK-test-chapelpost

      writeln();

   is 

   .. code-block:: printoutput

      1 4 2 5 3 6 

.. _Parameter_For_Loops:

Parameter For Loops
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parameter for loops are unrolled by the compiler so that the index
variable is a parameter rather than a variable. The syntax for a
parameter for loop statement is given by: 

.. code-block:: syntax

   param-for-statement:
     'for' 'param' identifier 'in' param-iteratable-expression 'do' statement
     'for' 'param' identifier 'in' param-iteratable-expression block-statement

   param-iteratable-expression:
     range-literal
     range-literal 'by' integer-literal

Parameter for loops are restricted to iteration over range literals with
an optional by expression where the bounds and stride must be
parameters. The loop is then unrolled for each iteration.

.. _Label_Break_Continue:

The Break, Continue and Label Statements
----------------------------------------

The break- and continue-statements are used to alter the flow of control
within a loop construct. A break-statement causes flow to exit the
containing loop and resume with the statement immediately following it.
A continue-statement causes control to jump to the end of the body of
the containing loop and resume execution from there. By default, break-
and continue-statements exit or skip the body of the
immediately-containing loop construct.

The label-statement is used to name a specific loop so that ``break``
and ``continue`` can exit or resume a less-nested loop. Labels can only
be attached to for-, while-do- and do-while-statements. When a break
statement has a label, execution continues with the first statement
following the loop statement with the matching label. When a continue
statement has a label, execution continues at the end of the body of the
loop with the matching label. If there is no containing loop construct
with a matching label, a compile-time error occurs.

The syntax for label, break, and continue statements is given by:


.. code-block:: syntax

   break-statement:
     'break' identifier[OPT] ;

   continue-statement:
     'continue' identifier[OPT] ;

   label-statement:
     'label' identifier statement

A ``break`` statement cannot be used to exit a parallel loop
:ref:`Forall`.

   *Rationale*.

   Breaks are not permitted in parallel loops because the execution
   order of the iterations of parallel loops is not defined.

..

.. note::

  *Future:*
    
    We expect to support a *eureka* concept which would enable one or
    more tasks to stop the execution of all current and future iterations
    of the loop.


*Example*.

   In the following code, the index of the first element in each row of
   ``A`` that is equal to ``findVal`` is printed. Once a match is found,
   the continue statement is executed causing the outer loop to move to
   the next row. 

   .. code-block:: chapel

      label outer for i in 1..n {
        for j in 1..n {
          if A[i, j] == findVal {
            writeln("index: ", (i, j), " matches.");
            continue outer;
          }
        }
      }

.. _The_Use_Statement:

The Use Statement
-----------------

The use statement provides access to the constants in an enumerated type
or to the public symbols of a module without the need to use a fully
qualified name. When using a module, the statement also ensures that the
module symbol itself is visible within the current scope (top-level
modules are not otherwise visible without a ``use``).

Use statements can also restrict or rename the set of module symbols that are
available within the scope. For further information about ``use`` statements,
see :ref:`Using_Modules`.  For more information on enumerated types, please
see :ref:`Enumerated_Types`.  For more information on modules in general, please
see :ref:`Chapter-Modules`.

.. _The_Import_Statement:

The Import Statement
--------------------

The ``import`` statement provides one of the two primary ways to access a
module's symbols from outside of the module, the other being the ``use``
statement.  Import statements make either the module's name or certain symbols
within it available for reference within a given scope.  For top-level modules,
an ``import`` or ``use`` statement is required before referring to the module's
name or the symbols it contains within a given lexical scope.

Import statements can also rename the set of symbols that they make available
within the scope.  For further information about ``import`` statements, see
:ref:`Importing_Modules`.

For more information on modules in general, please see :ref:`Chapter-Modules`.

.. _The_Defer_Statement:

The Defer Statement
-------------------

A ``defer`` statement declares a clean-up action to be run when exiting
a block. ``defer`` is useful because the clean-up action will be run no
matter how the block is exited.

The syntax is:

.. code-block:: syntax

   defer-statement:
     'defer' statement

At each place where control flow exits a block, the compiler will add
cleanup actions for the in-scope ``defer`` statements that have executed and
for the local variables that have been initialized in that block.

The cleanup action for a ``defer`` statement is to run its body. The
cleanup action for a variable is to run its deinitializer. See
:ref:`Variable_Lifetimes`.

When a block contains multiple defer statements, their cleanup actions
will be run in reverse declaration order. Additionally, note that cleanup
actions for defer statements may be interleaved among cleanup actions for
variables. To understand the interleaving, imagine that the defer
statement is declaring and initializing a local variable with a
deinitializer that runs the body of the defer statement.

When an iterator contains a ``defer`` statement at the top level, the
associated clean-up action will be executed when the loop running the
iterator exits. ``defer`` actions inside a loop body are executed when
that iteration completes.

The following program demonstrates a simple use of ``defer`` to create
an action to be executed when returning from a function:

   *Example (defer1.chpl)*.

   

   .. code-block:: chapel

      class Integer {
        var x:int;
      }
      proc deferInFunction() {
        var c = new unmanaged Integer(1);
        writeln("created ", c);
        defer {
          writeln("defer action: deleting ", c);
          delete c;
        }
        // ... (function body, possibly including return statements)
        // The defer action is executed no matter how this function returns.
      }
      deferInFunction();

   produces the output 

   .. BLOCK-test-chapeloutput

      created {x = 1}
      defer action: deleting {x = 1}

   .. code-block:: bash

      created {x = 1}
      defer action: deleting {x = 1}

The following example uses a nested block to demonstrate that ``defer``
is handled when exiting the block in which it is contained:

   *Example (defer2.chpl)*.

   

   .. code-block:: chapel

      class Integer {
        var x:int;
      }
      proc deferInNestedBlock() {
        var i = 1;
        writeln("before inner block");
        {
          var c = new unmanaged Integer(i);
          writeln("created ", c);
          defer {
            writeln("defer action: deleting ", c);
            delete c;
          }
          writeln("in inner block");
          // note, defer action is executed no matter how this block is exited
        }
        writeln("after inner block");
      }
      deferInNestedBlock();

   produces the output 

   .. BLOCK-test-chapeloutput

      before inner block
      created {x = 1}
      in inner block
      defer action: deleting {x = 1}
      after inner block

   .. code-block:: bash

      before inner block
      created {x = 1}
      in inner block
      defer action: deleting {x = 1}
      after inner block

The next example shows that when ``defer`` is used in a loop, the
action will be executed for every loop iteration, whether or not loop
body is exited early.

   *Example (defer3.chpl)*.

   

   .. code-block:: chapel

      class Integer {
        var x:int;
      }
      proc deferInLoop() {
        for i in 1..10 {
          var c = new unmanaged Integer(i);
          writeln("created ", c);
          defer {
            writeln("defer action: deleting ", c);
            delete c;
          }
          writeln(c);
          if i == 2 then
            break;
        }
      }
      deferInLoop();

   produces the output 

   .. BLOCK-test-chapeloutput

      created {x = 1}
      {x = 1}
      defer action: deleting {x = 1}
      created {x = 2}
      {x = 2}
      defer action: deleting {x = 2}

   .. code-block:: bash

      created {x = 1}
      {x = 1}
      defer action: deleting {x = 1}
      created {x = 2}
      {x = 2}
      defer action: deleting {x = 2}

Lastly, this example shows that `defer` statements that have not executed
have no effect. Only a `defer` statement that has executed will have its
cleanup action run.

   *Example (defer4.chpl)*.

   

   .. code-block:: chapel

      proc deferControl(condition: bool) {
        if condition {
          defer {
            writeln("Inside if");
          }
        }
        return;
        defer {
          writeln("After return");
        }
      }
      writeln("Condition: false");
      deferControl(false);
      writeln("Condition: true");
      deferControl(true);

   produces the output 

   .. BLOCK-test-chapeloutput

      Condition: false
      Condition: true
      Inside if

   .. code-block:: bash

      Condition: false
      Condition: true
      Inside if

.. _The_Empty_Statement:

The Empty Statement
-------------------

An empty statement has no effect. The syntax of an empty statement is
given by 

.. code-block:: syntax

   empty-statement:
     ;
