=====

Chapel is a new parallel programming language that was initiated at
Cray Inc. in the context of the DARPA High Productivity Computing
Systems initiative.  Its development is ongoing at Hewlett Packard
Enterprise.

This document is ultimately intended to be the definitive specification
of the Chapel language. The current draft is a work-in-progress and
therefore incomplete.
