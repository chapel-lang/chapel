Chapel Contributor Agreements
=============================

In November 2020, Chapel switched from requiring Apache Contributor
Licensing Agreements (CLAs) from each contributor to using commits
signed in acceptance of the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).
For more information including the text of the DCO, please refer to
[CONTRIBUTING.md][0].  For tips on getting set up with signed commits,
please refer to [Chapel's use of the Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)][1].
