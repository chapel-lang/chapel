README files
------------

The repository has a collection of README files on various topics. The
main file is $CHPL_HOME/README.rst.  Each file points to other related
READMEs so that any README can be reached from the main one by
following such "links".

Some directories also have README.devel, which contain additional
information for Chapel developers. They are not (necessarily)
referenced in the above collection.

The non-.devel READMEs are written so they are relevant to *users* of
Chapel. Therefore they reflect the directory structure of Chapel's
public releases; see $CHPL_HOME/README.devel for details.
