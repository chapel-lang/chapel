Standard Module Style
=====================

This document describes general guidance for style when writing a
standard module. Of course, there will be exceptions to this guidance when
there is a good reason.

PascalCase and camelCase
------------------------

Prefer PascalCase or camelCase to separating_with_underscores. The rest
of this document will use PascalCase or camelCase to signify the pattern
of indicating new words with an upper case letter and starting the
identifier; where PascalCase starts the name with an upper case letter
and camelCase starts with a lower case letter.

When including acronyms in PascalCase or camelCase, treat the acronym as
if it were a regular word. There is one exception - if using PascalCase
and the acronym is the entire symbol name, then let the acronym be all
uppercase.

Here are a few examples:
 * "rendered HTML DOM" in PascalCase is RenderedHtmlDom
 * "rendered HTML DOM" in camelCase is renderedHtmlDom
 * "HTML" in PascalCase is HTML
 * "HTML" in camelCase is html

Exceptions:
 The following are exceptions to the above capitalization guidelines that occur
 in the standard modules or packages:

  * :proc:`~ChapelLocale.locale.numPUs` (num Processor-Units)

 Our hope and intention is to update our rules over time so that they cover
 cases like this, obviating the need to call it out as an exception. As more
 exceptions accumulate, rules may be amended to cover multiple cases at once.

Modules
-------

Module names should be PascalCase.

.. note::

  Chapel does not use a separate namespace for types vs. module names. As
  a result, it's generally a goal to avoid using the same name for, say,
  a type and a module.

Classes
-------

Class type names should be PascalCase. The idea is that starting with an
uppercase letter is the convention for by-reference types.

Records
-------

Record type names should be camelCase. The idea is that starting with a
lowercase letter is the convention for by-value types.

Enums
-----

Enum type names should be camelCase. The enum values should also be
camelCase.

Functions and Methods
---------------------

Function and method names should be camelCase.

Generally speaking, it's desirable to use methods on a value (vs
functions that aren't methods) when there is a clear type responsible for
the operation.

Use parentheses-less methods only for returning properties that could be
reasonably implemented as fields. However, if such a method is named
isXYZ or hasXYZ it should use parentheses (so, use
``proc isReal() { ...  }`` rather than ``proc isReal { ... }``).
Parentheses-less functions that aren't methods should be avoided.

Many paren-ful methods take some notable action. Try to make these
methods method names be a verb. In particular, a method that modifies an
argument in-place should be a verb.

Factory Functions and Methods
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Factory functions or methods are procedures where the main purpose of
that procedure is to create a new object or value. There are many other
procedures that return a value but constructing that value is not the main
purpose of the function. For example, 'open' and 'spawn' are not factory
functions -- the main action of these methods is to work with the OS to
open a file or launch a subprocess.

In many cases factory procedures are not needed. Regular initializers
will work just fine to support the pattern of ``new Something(...)``.
Type conversion is best supported by creating a cast (``:``) operator
overload.

One case in which factory procedures are useful is when it is awkward to
distinguish between several ways of creating something based on the
initializer arguments alone.

Factory procedures should have a name that begin with 'create'.

Factory procedures can be functions or type methods. For example, we
could have:

 * ``createStringWithBorrowedBuffer`` or
 * ``string.createBorrowingBuffer``.

Accessors
+++++++++

Accessor methods are methods intended to return a distinct piece of information
about the type on which they are defined.  This piece of information could be
reasonably implemented as a field.  Typically, such methods are defined without
parentheses, allowing them to appear similar to a field access.  However, there
is no requirement that the contents of the accessor be similarly simple -
whether the information returned is calculated based on the internal fields of
the type or whether it is actually a field is an implementation detail.

Accessor methods will avoid using "get" in their name.  E.g., instead of
``array.getIdxType``, the accessor is named ``array.idxType``.

Methods that are not accessors are still allowed to use "get" in their name.

Other Identifiers
-----------------

Variables, fields, and argument names should be camelCase or PascalCase.
