Unstable Features
=================

When it is known that a feature is likely to require discussion or changes but
it is uncertain how the interface would be changed, the feature can be
designated "unstable".  When compiling Chapel code with the flag
``--warn-unstable``, unstable features will generate a warning when used.

Unstable features have no explicit timeline for stabilization.

There are two ways to mark a feature as unstable:

1. Use the ``@unstable`` attribute and optionally a string literal message.  This
   strategy is best for symbols, as it can be applied to any symbol in a uniform
   way.  Look in the test/unstable and test/unstable-keyword directories for
   many examples.

   When a string literal is not provided, the default message is ``foo is
   unstable``, where ``foo`` will be replaced with the name of the symbol in
   question.  This message will be used for the unstable symbol's documentation
   and for the message generated by the compiler with the ``--warn-unstable``
   flag.  If there is a documentation comment applied to the symbol, that
   comment will take precedence when producing documentation.  When the compiler
   produces a warning, it will be filtered to remove any inline markup.

   This means that if your unstable message points to a more stable feature like
   this: ``foo is unstable - please use :proc:`bar```, then in the generated
   documentation "bar" will link to the documentation for the "bar" procedure
   and when producing the compiler warning the ":proc:" syntax and backticks
   will be filtered out.

2. Add a check against ``chpl_warnUnstable`` and use ``compilerWarning()`` to
   generate the message.  This strategy is best for features that can't be
   represented by a symbol with the ``@unstable`` attribute.

All unstable features should have a test added to ``test/unstable`` to:

  - confirm the unstable warning works as intended
  - remind us to take the necessary actions to stabilize the unstable feature,
    whether that be design discussions or ultimately removing the feature.
