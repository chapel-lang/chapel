Chapel's Deprecation Policy
===========================

When removing a feature in Chapel, the feature is to be
deprecated and supported for at least 1 release cycle.

Major feature removals can be supported for more than 1 release cycle.

Non-public interface features can be removed or modified without deprecation.

This is the deprecation process:

1. Provide a warning or error message when a deprecated feature is used. This
   may be in the module code, compiler, or runtime, and can be emitted at
   compile-time or runtime.

The deprecation message uses the following format:

..code-block::

    foo is deprecated - please use bar

2. Update the deprecated feature documentation to state that it is deprecated
   and point to the preferred feature.

For example:

..code-block:: rst

    Foo module short description.

    .. warning::

        This module has been deprecated - please use :mod:`bar` instead.

    Foo module long description.


3. Add a deprecation test to ``test/deprecated/`` to:

  - confirm the deprecation warning works as intended
  - remind us to to remove the deprecated feature in the following release

Optionally include deprecation timeline in comments of deprecation test:

.. code-block:: chapel

    // Deprecated in Chapel 1.14, to be removed in Chapel 1.15
