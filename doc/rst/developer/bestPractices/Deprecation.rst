Chapel's Deprecation Policy
===========================

Chapel's general policy for deprecation is to:

- Provide a compiler warning (or error) when a deprecated feature is used
- Continue to document and support the deprecated feature for 1 release cycle
  - The documentation should contain a pointer to the preferred feature
  - This holds true for modules as well
