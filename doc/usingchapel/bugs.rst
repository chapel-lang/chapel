Reporting Chapel Issues
=======================

Public Issues
-------------

Chapel uses `GitHub Issues`_ to track public issues. If you have a bug report,
feature request, or other Chapel issue to report, please use the "New Issue"
button on that page to file it.

Public issues that predate our issue tracker can be found in the
``$CHPL_HOME/STATUS`` file and the (retired)
`chapel-bugs mailing list archives`_.

Private Issues
--------------

Chapel accepts private issue reports :ref:`by email <readme-privatebugs>`.
