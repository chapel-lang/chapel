Next Steps
----------
Base:
 - type, .type, casts
 - param
 - const
 

ASAP
----
* fix poorly formatted code in locale type vars section.
* point spec to somewhere within the docs directory, version independent.

Later
-----
* When on-clauses section is written, link into first locale section
* Four major sections
  - better landing page or way to link to them other than anchors?
  - do something smarter/cooler with the sidebar

Second pass
-----------
* Replace 'layer' with something else for runtime options?  Or embrace
  layer?

Future
------
* As numa locale model comes on line introduce hierarchical locales
  into the locality section (currently, the localesInChapel.rst file
  brushes them off).  And/or as we have better written material
  describing hierarchical locales, point to that.
