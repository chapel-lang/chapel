Chapel is a new parallel programming language that is under
development at Cray Inc. in the context of the DARPA High Productivity
Computing Systems initiative.

This document is ultimately intended to be the definitive
specification of the Chapel language.  The current draft is a
work-in-progress and therefore incomplete.
