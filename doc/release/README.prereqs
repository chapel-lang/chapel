====================================
Chapel Prerequisites and Assumptions
====================================

If you have a standard UNIX environment, a C/C++ compiler, some basic
scripting languages, a GNU-compatible make, and awk installed you should
have no problems getting started with Chapel.

In slightly more detail the following are prerequisites and assumptions
about your environment for using Chapel:

* You are using an environment that supports standard UNIX commands
  such as: cd, mkdir, rm, echo

* You have the Bourne shell available at /bin/sh, the C-shell
  available at /bin/csh, 'env' available at /usr/bin/env, and that
  'env' can locate Perl and Python on your system.

* You have access to gmake or a GNU-compatible version of make.

* You have access to standard C and C++ compilers. We test our code
  using a range of compilers on a nightly basis; these include relatively
  recent versions of gcc/g++, clang, and compilers from Cray, Intel, and PGI.

We have used the following commands to set up newly installed system images.
Note that our test system works much better with tcsh installed.

CentOS 6.5, 6.6, 7.0:
sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++ perl python tcsh bash make gawk

SLES 11 SP3:
sudo zypper install gcc gcc-c++ perl python tcsh bash make gawk

Debian 7.8, Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 14.10:
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ perl python tcsh bash make mawk
