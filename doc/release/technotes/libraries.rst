Exporting Chapel as a Library
=============================

.. note::

   This page discusses the implementation of libraries, which are still
   under development.  The idea is to allow components to be developed in
   Chapel and linked with other programs and languages.  It is currently fragile
   and difficult to work with.

Normally, Chapel assumes that you are building a main program and produces a
main routine whether one is explicitly coded or not.  When the ``--library``
flag is provided on the command line, it tells the Chapel compiler to produce a
library instead.  The user can further specify (through the ``--static``
and ``--dynamic`` flags) which type of library to produce.  If
neither ``--static`` nor ``--dynamic`` is specified, a platform-dependent
default library type is produced.

Some platforms support linking against both static and dynamic versions of
the same library.  On those platforms, the ``--static`` or ``--dynamic``
flag can be used to select which type of library (and thus which kind of
linking) is performed by default.  Library files which are named explicitly on
the ``chpl`` command line take precedence over any found through object
library paths (``-L``).  Where there is a conflict, the last library
specified takes precedence.

When creating a library file from Chapel code, only those symbols with
``export`` attached to them will be available from outside the library.  For
example, if one defines a Chapel file ``foo.chpl`` like this:

.. code-block:: Chapel

   // This function will be available to the library user
   export proc bar(): int {
     // Does something
     ...
   }

   // As will this one
   export proc baz(int x) {
     // Does something different
     ...
   }

   // but this function will not be
   proc gloop() {
     // Does something else
     ...
   }

When using a Chapel library file in C code, a fairly exact incantation is
required.  First, a header file must be created for the library.  This does not
happen through use of the Chapel ``--library`` flag during compilation!  If
during compilation of the library the ``--savec <dir>`` flag is also used, the C
definitions for the exported functions should be visible in a C file under
*dir* of the same name as the library Chapel file.  A declaration version of
these definitions should go into a ``.h`` file.  For instance, if one compiled
``foo.chpl`` like this:

.. code-block:: sh

   chpl --library --savec cDir --static -o libfoo foo.chpl


then under ``cDir/foo.c`` one might see something resembling:

.. code-block:: C

   int64_t bar(void) {
     ...
   }

   void baz(int64_t x) {
     ...
   }

from which one would create a ``.h`` file:

.. code-block:: C

   int64_t bar(void);
   void baz(int64_t x);

It may be necessary to ``#include`` some Chapel headers, such as
``chpl-string.h``, depending on the types used in your Chapel library.

Next, if compiling dynamically, update the ``$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` environment
variable to include the directory where the new library file lives and the
directory where the Chapel build lives.  The latter can be found by looking at
the output of a ``$CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv`` call and finding the
appropriate directory under ``$CHPL_HOME/lib``; the directory name can be found
by running ``$CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv --runtime``.

.. code-block:: sh

   # Replace $PWD with the appropriate path to your library file if it isn't
   # in the current directory
   # Replace libDir with the directory we just found.
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$CHPL_HOME/lib/`$CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv --runtime`:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH


When using a Chapel library from C, one must first initialize the Chapel runtime
and standard modules.  This is done by the addition of a couple of extern
declarations, calling the function ``chpl_library_init()`` before the Chapel
library function calls and by calling ``chpl_library_finalize()`` after all the
Chapel library function calls are finished.  For example:

.. code-block:: C

   #include "foo.h"

   extern void chpl_library_init(int argc, char* argv[]);
   extern void chpl_library_finalize(void);

   int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
       chpl_library_init(argc, argv);

       baz(7); // Call into a library function

       chpl_library_finalize();

       return 0;
   }

Finally, compilation of the C program involves some additional command line
includes and links.  The easiest way to get the right combination is by using
the ``compileline --compile`` and ``compileline --libraries`` tools we provide.
The compilation command would then look like this (replacing myprog.c with the
name of your C program):

.. code-block:: sh

   `$CHPL_HOME/util/config/compileline --compile` myprog.c -L. -lfoo `$CHPL_HOME/util/config/compileline --libraries`

Chapel library files cannot be used from Chapel code.  The library files must
include the chapel runtime and standard modules for use in a non-Chapel program
and when the library is linked to a Chapel program this leads to multiple
definitions of these functions.

As mentioned above, this feature is not very sturdy.  Please refer to
:ref:`readme-bugs` if any problems are encountered.
