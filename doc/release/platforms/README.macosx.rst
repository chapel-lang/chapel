==================================
Using Chapel on a Mac running OS X
==================================

By and large, Chapel can be used on a Macintosh running OS X just like
any other platform -- refer to the top-level README file for general
instructions on building and using Chapel.

For Macintosh developers, there is an Xcode project file located in

``$CHPL_HOME/make/Chapel.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj``

that can be used to develop Chapel within Xcode by opening the project

``$CHPL_HOME/make/Chapel.xcodeproj``

Be forewarned that we do not maintain this project very regularly and
appreciate updates to the project file from external contributors.
