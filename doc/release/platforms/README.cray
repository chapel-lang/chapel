===============================
Using Chapel on Cray(R) Systems
===============================

The following information is assembled to help Chapel users get up and
running on Cray systems including the Cray XC(TM), XE(TM), XK(TM), and
CS(TM) series systems.


----------------------------------------------------
Getting Started with Chapel on Cray X-Series Systems
----------------------------------------------------

Chapel is available as a module for Cray X-series systems.  When it is
installed on your system, you do not need to build Chapel from the
source release (though you can); instead, simply load the module
using:

     module load chapel

Then proceed directly to "Using Chapel on a Cray System" below.  If
instead you wish to build Chapel from source, continue on to "Building
Chapel on a Cray System from Source" just below.

For information on obtaining and installing the Chapel module please
contact your system administrator.


----------------------------------------------
Getting Started with Chapel on Cray CS Systems
----------------------------------------------

On Cray CS systems, Chapel is not currently available as a module due
to the wide diversity of software packages that Cray CS customers may
choose to install on their system.  For this reason, Chapel must be
built from source on Cray CS systems using the instructions just
below.


---------------------------------------------
Building Chapel for a Cray System from Source
---------------------------------------------

1) If using a XC, XE, or XK system, continue to step 2. If using a
   CS series system, set CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM to "cray-cs".

   For example:

     export CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM=cray-cs

   These are the supported systems and strings.  Note that these values
   are used by default when building on the given systems.  They can
   also be set manually.  Also note that the cray-xe configuration
   covers Cray XK systems as well as Cray XE systems.

       System       CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM
       ---------    ------------------
       CS series        cray-cs
       XC series        cray-xc
       XE series        cray-xe
       XK series        cray-xe


2) Optionally, set the CHPL_LAUNCHER environment variable to indicate
   how Chapel should launch jobs on your system:

   On a Cray CS system, to...                   set CHPL_LAUNCHER to...
     ...run jobs interactively on your system     gasnetrun_ibv
     ...queue jobs using PBSPro (qsub)            pbs-gasnetrun_ibv
     ...queue jobs using SLURM (sbatch)           slurm-gasnetrun_ibv
     ...queue jobs using LSF (bsub)               lsf-gasnetrun_ibv

     (On Cray CS systems, CHPL_LAUNCHER defaults to 'gasnetrun_ibv')


   On a Cray X-series system, to...             set CHPL_LAUNCHER to...
     ...run jobs interactively on your system     aprun
     ...queue jobs using PBS (qsub)               pbs-aprun
     ...queue jobs using SLURM (sbatch)           slurm-srun

     (On Cray X-Series systems, CHPL_LAUNCHER defaults to 'aprun' if
     it is in your path; 'none' otherwise)

   You can also set CHPL_LAUNCHER to 'none' if you prefer to manually
   manage all queuing and job launch commands yourself.

   For more information on Chapel's launcher capabilities and options,
   refer to $CHPL_HOME/doc/README.launcher.


3) Select the target compiler that Chapel should use when compiling
   code for the compute node:

   On a Cray CS series system, set the CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER
     environment variable to indicate which compiler to use (and make
     sure that the compiler is in your path).

     To request...                    set CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER to...

       ...the GNU compiler (gcc)        gnu    (the default)
       ...the Intel compiler (icc)      intel
       ...the PGI compiler (pgcc)       pgi


   On a Cray X-series system, ensure that you have one of the
     following Programming Environment modules loaded to specify your
     target compiler:

       - PrgEnv-cray
       - PrgEnv-gnu
       - PrgEnv-intel
       - PrgEnv-pgi


4) By default, g++ will be used to compile code that runs on the login
   node, such as the Chapel compiler and launcher code.  Optionally,
   you can override this default by setting CHPL_HOST_COMPILER to one
   of the following values:

     cray      : the Cray compiler suite -- cc and CC
     gnu       : the GNU compiler suite -- gcc and g++
     intel     : the Intel compiler suite -- icc and icpc
     pgi       : the PGI compiler suite -- pgcc and pgCC


5) Optionally, set one or more of the following environment variables to
   configure the Chapel build.  These are described in greater detail in
   README.chplenv.

     CHPL_TASKS : tasking implementation, default "fifo" when using
                  target compiler "cray", otherwise "qthreads"
     CHPL_COMM : communication implementation, default "gasnet"

   Other configuration environment variables such as CHPL_MEM can also
   be set, but this is more typical when doing internal development.
   For production work the configuration scripts should always select an
   appropriate default for these.

   Note that the Cray-specific settings of "muxed" tasking and "ugni"
   communications cannot be selected when building Chapel from source,
   because the corresponding runtime layers are not distributed in
   source form.  These settings can only be selected when using the
   pre-built Chapel module.


6) Make sure you're in the top-level chapel/ directory and make/re-make the
   compiler and runtime:

     gmake

   Note that a single Chapel installation can support multiple
   configurations simultaneously and that you can switch between them
   simply by changing any of the above settings.  However, each
   configuration must be built separately.  Thus, you can change any of
   the settings in the steps before this, and then re-run this step in
   order to create additional installations.  Thereafter, you can switch
   between any of these configurations without rebuilding.


-----------------------------
Using Chapel on a Cray System
-----------------------------

1) If you are working from a Chapel module...

     a) Load the module using 'module load chapel'
     b) Optionally select a launcher, as in step 2 above
     c) Select a target compiler, as in step 3 above

   If you are working from a source installation...

     a) Set your host platform as in step 1 above
     b) Optionally select a launcher, as in step 2 above
     c) Select a target compiler, as in step 3 above
     d) Set CHPL_HOME and your paths by invoking the appropriate
        util/setchplenv script for your shell.  For example:

          source util/setchplenv.bash


2) Optionally, set one or more of the following environment variables to
   select a Chapel configuration.  These are described in greater detail
   in README.chplenv.

     CHPL_TASKS : tasking implementation, default "fifo" with target
                  compiler "cray", "muxed" on Cray XC/XE with pre-built
                  module, otherwise "qthreads"
     CHPL_COMM  : communication implementation, default "ugni" on Cray
                  XC/XE with pre-built module, else "gasnet"

   Other configuration environment variables such as CHPL_MEM can also
   be set, but this is more typical when doing internal development.
   For production work the configuration scripts should always select an
   appropriate default for these.

   The configuration selected must be one that is present in the Chapel
   installation being used, whether that is a source distribution or the
   pre-built module.  If it is not, the Chapel compiler will produce an
   error message saying so when you try to compile anything.  If you get
   this error, you will need to build the desired configuration (if you
   are working from source) or modify your configuration so that it is
   one of those supplied (if you are working with the pre-built module).


3) Compile your Chapel program.  For example:

      chpl -o hello6-taskpar-dist $CHPL_HOME/examples/hello6-taskpar-dist.chpl

   See README.compiling or 'man chpl' for further details.


4) If CHPL_LAUNCHER is set to anything other than 'none', when you
   compile a Chapel program for your Cray system, you will see two
   binaries (e.g., hello6-taskpar-dist and hello6-taskpar-dist_real).
   The first binary contains code to launch the Chapel program onto
   the compute nodes, as specified by your CHPL_LAUNCHER setting.  The
   second contains the program code itself; it is not intended to be
   executed directly from the shell prompt.

   You can use the -v flag to see the commands used by the launcher
   binary to start your program.

   If CHPL_LAUNCHER is pbs-aprun or pbs-gasnetrun_ibv:

     a) You can optionally specify a queue name using the environment
        variable CHPL_LAUNCHER_QUEUE.  For example:

          export CHPL_LAUNCHER_QUEUE=batch

        If this variable is left unset, no queue name will be
        specified.  Alternatively, you can set the queue name on your
        Chapel program command line using the --queue flag.

     b) You can also optionally set a wall clock time limit for the
        job using CHPL_LAUNCHER_WALLTIME.  For example to specify a
        10-minute time limit, use:

          export CHPL_LAUNCHER_WALLTIME=00:10:00

        Alternatively, you can set the wall clock time limit on your
        Chapel program command line using the --walltime flag.

   If CHPL_LAUNCHER is slurm-gasnetrun_ibv:

     You must set the amount of time to request from SLURM.
     For example, the following requests 15 minutes:

          export CHPL_LAUNCHER_WALLTIME=00:15:00

   For further information about launchers, please refer to
   $CHPL_HOME/doc/README.launcher.


5) Execute your Chapel program.  Multi-locale executions require the
   number of locales (compute nodes) to be specified on the command
   line.  For example:

     ./hello6-taskpar-dist -nl 2

   Requests the program to be executed using two locales.


6) If your Cray system has compute nodes with varying numbers of
   cores, you can request nodes with at least a certain number of
   cores using the variable CHPL_LAUNCHER_CORES_PER_LOCALE.  For
   example, on a Cray system in which some compute nodes have 24 or
   more cores per compute node, you could request nodes with at least
   24 cores using:

      export CHPL_LAUNCHER_CORES_PER_LOCALE=24

   This variable may be needed when you are using the aprun launcher and
   running Chapel programs within batch jobs you are managing yourself.
   The aprun launcher currently creates aprun commands that request the
   maximum number of cores per locale found on any locale in the system,
   irrespective of the fact that the batch job may have a lower limit
   than that on the number of cores per locale.  If the batch job limit
   is less than the maximum number of cores per locale, you will get the
   following error message when you try to run a Chapel program:

      apsched: claim exceeds reservation's CPUs

   You can work around this by setting CHPL_LAUNCHER_CORES_PER_LOCALE to
   the same or lesser value as the number of cores per locale specified
   for the batch job (for example, the mppdepth resource for the PBS
   qsub command).  In the future we hope to achieve better integration
   between Chapel launchers and workload managers.


7) If your Cray system has compute nodes with varying numbers of CPUs
   per compute unit, you can request nodes with a certain number of
   CPUs per compute unit using the variable CHPL_LAUNCHER_CPUS_PER_CU.
   For example, on a Cray XC series system with some nodes having at
   least 2 CPUs per compute unit, to request running on those nodes
   you would use:

      export CHPL_LAUNCHER_CPUS_PER_CU=2

   Currently, the only legal values for CHPL_LAUNCHER_CPUS_PER_CU are
   0 (the default), 1, and 2.

--------------------------------------
Cray File Systems and Chapel execution
--------------------------------------

For best results, it is recommended that you execute your Chapel
program by placing the binaries on a file system shared between the
login node and compute nodes (typically Lustre), as this will provide
the greatest degree of transparency when executing your program.  In
some cases, running a Chapel program from a non-shared file system
will make it impossible to launch onto the compute nodes.  In other
cases, the launch will succeed, but any files read or written by the
Chapel program will be opened relative to the compute node's file
system rather than the login node's.


----------------------------------------------------
Special Notes for Cray XC, XE, and XK Series Systems
----------------------------------------------------

Controlling the Heap Size
-------------------------

When running on Cray XC/XE/XK systems using either of the following
configurations, the comm layer needs to know the maximum size the
program heap will grow to during execution:

  CHPL_COMM=gasnet
    CHPL_COMM_SUBSTRATE=gemini or aries
    CHPL_GASNET_SEGMENT=fast or large

  -- or --

  CHPL_COMM=ugni

With CHPL_COMM=gasnet, by default the heap will occupy as much of the
free memory on each locale (compute node) as the runtime can acquire,
less some amount to allow for demands from other (system) programs
running there.  With CHPL_COMM=ugni, by default the heap will occupy 2/3
of the free memory on each locale.  With the ugni comm layer and slurm
job placement, however, the default is reduced to 16 GiB if that is
less.  See "Communication Layer Concurrency and Slurm", below, for more
information.

Advanced users may want to make the heap smaller than this.  Programs
start more quickly with a smaller heap, and in the unfortunate event
that you need to produce core files, those will be written more quickly
if the heap is smaller.  However, note that if you reduce the heap size
to less than the amount your program actually needs and then run it, it
will terminate prematurely due to not having enough memory.

To change the heap size, set the CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE environment
variable.  Set it to just a number to specify the size of the heap in
bytes, or to a number with a "k" or "K", "m" or "M", or "g" or "G"
suffix with no intervening spaces to specify the heap size in KiB (2^10
bytes), MiB (2^20 bytes), or GiB (2^30 bytes), respectively.  Any of the
following would set the heap size to 1 GiB, for example:

  export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1073741824
  export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1048576k
  export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1024m
  export CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE=1g

Note that the value you set in CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE may get rounded up
internally to match the page alignment.  How much, if any, this will add
depends on the hugepage size in the hugepage module you have loaded at
the time you execute the program.

Note that for CHPL_COMM=gasnet, CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE is synonymous with
GASNET_MAX_SEGSIZE, and the former overrides the latter if both are set.


Native Runtime Layers
---------------------

The README.multilocale and README.tasking files describe a variety of
communication and tasking layers that can be used by Chapel programs.
In addition to the standard runtime layers available in any Chapel
release, the pre-built Chapel module for Cray XC and XE series systems
supports Cray-specific communication and tasking layers.  These make use
of the Cray systems' hardware and/or software to produce enhanced
performance for Chapel programs.  When using the pre-built module on
Cray XC or XE systems the allowed combinations are ugni communications
with muxed tasking (the default), and ugni communications with qthreads
tasking.  On other kinds of Cray systems or when not using the pre-built
module, the default is to use gasnet communications and qthreads
tasking.

Note that neither the ugni communication layer nor the muxed tasking
layer can be built from sources, as they are not distributed in source
form.

The ugni communication layer interacts with the system's network
interface very closely through a lightweight interface called uGNI (user
Generic Network Interface).  The muxed tasking layer switches Chapel
tasks and threads in a lightweight manner in user space, avoiding the
overhead and some of the resource limitations associated with OS thread
switching.  These layers cooperate to overlap communication to remote
locales with task execution, particularly improving the performance of
programs limited by the latency of small remote data references, such as
graph analytic applications.


Using the "ugni" Communications Layer
-------------------------------------

To use ugni communications:

1) Make sure that you are using either the GNU or Intel target
   compiler.

     module load PrgEnv-gnu

     -- or --

     module load PrgEnv-intel

   (If you have a different PrgEnv module loaded, you will have to
   unload it first, or do a swap instead of a load.)


2) Set your CHPL_COMM environment variable to "ugni".

     export CHPL_COMM=ugni

   This specifies that you wish to use the Cray-specific communication
   layer.


3) Set your CHPL_TASKS environment variable to "muxed" or "qthreads".

     export CHPL_TASKS=muxed

     -- or --

     export CHPL_TASKS=qthreads

   Only these two tasking layers work with ugni communications.  Other
   Chapel environment variables having to do with runtime layers should
   be left unset.  Setting CHPL_COMM and CHPL_TASKS like this will cause
   the correct combination of other runtime layers that work with those
   to be selected automatically.


4) Load an appropriate craype-hugepages module.  For example:

     module load craype-hugepages16M

   Use of the ugni communication layer requires that the program's data
   reside on so-called "hugepages".  To arrange for this, you must have
   a craype-hugepages module loaded both when building your program and
   when running it.

   There are several hugepage modules, with suffixes indicating the page
   size they support.  For example, craype-hugepages16M supports 16 MiB
   hugepages.  It does not matter which craype-hugepages module you have
   loaded when you build your program.  Any of them will do.  However,
   which one you have loaded when you run your program does matter.  For
   general use, the Chapel group recommends the craype-hugepages16M
   module.  You can read on for more information about craype-hugepage
   modules if you would like, but the recommended craype-hugepages16M
   module will probably give you satisfactory results.

   The architecture of the Cray network interface chips (NICs) limits
   them to addressing at most 16k (2**14) pages of memory.  This is
   sufficient to cover a 32 GiB Cray XC locale with 2 MiB pages.  But
   if you will be running on 64 GiB locales, you will need to use at
   least 4 MiB pages to cover all of the memory.  Generally, using
   larger hugepage sizes results in modest performance benefits,
   mostly in program startup time.  The craype-hugepages16M module
   will result in slightly faster program startup, and its 16 MiB
   hugepages will cover the locale memory on any Cray X-series system.

   The only downside to larger page sizes is that they can waste more
   memory than smaller page sizes do, when the data segments that reside
   on them are smaller than the hugepage size (which is often the case).
   In practice, however, the effect of this is minor.  Even using the
   fairly large 16 MiB hugepages will typically only result in around 1%
   of the total locale memory being wasted.


Due to the use of hugepages in the ugni comm layer, tasking layers
cannot use guard pages for stack overflow detection.  Qthreads tasking
uses guard pages for stack overflow detection, so if ugni communications
and qthreads tasking are combined, stack overflow detection in qthreads
is automatically turned off.  (Muxed tasking uses a different technique
to detect stack overflow, as described below, so it is not affected by
this limitation.)

There are a few special parameters recognized by the ugni communication
layer:

    Communication Layer Concurrency
    -------------------------------

    The CHPL_RT_COMM_CONCURRENCY environment variable tells the ugni
    communication layer how much program concurrency it should try to
    support.  This basically controls how much of the communication
    resources on the NIC will be used by the program.  The default
    value is the number of hardware processor cores the program will
    use for Chapel tasks (CHPL_RT_NUM_HARDWARE_THREADS in the next
    section).  Usually this is enough, but for highly parallel codes
    that do a lot of remote references, increasing it may help the
    performance.  Useful values for CHPL_RT_COMM_CONCURRENCY are in
    the range 1 to 30.  Values specified outside this range are
    silently increased or reduced so as to fall within it.


    Communication Layer Concurrency and Slurm
    -----------------------------------------

    When slurm is used for job placement on Cray systems, it limits the
    total NIC memory registration in order to allow for job sharing on
    the compute nodes.  In our experience this limit is approximately
    240 GiB.  The product of CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE and the communication
    layer concurrency discussed above must be less than this.  The ugni
    communication layer adjusts its heap size and concurrency defaults
    to reflect this limit when slurm is used for job placement.  The
    default heap size is reduced to 16 GiB.  The concurrency is computed
    such that the product of heap size and concurrency is below 240 GiB.
    Thus under slurm, the ugni communication layer can support programs
    with very large heaps or programs that need a lot of communication
    concurrency, but not programs that need both simultaneously.  Such
    programs need to be run on a system that uses ALPS instead of slurm
    for job placement.


Using the "muxed" Tasking Layer
-------------------------------

To use muxed tasking:

1) Make sure that you are using either the GNU or Intel target
   compiler.

     module load PrgEnv-gnu

     -- or --

     module load PrgEnv-intel

   (If you have a different PrgEnv module loaded, you will have to
   unload it first, or do a swap instead of a load.)


2) Set your CHPL_TASKS environment variable to "muxed".

     export CHPL_TASKS=muxed

   This specifies that you wish to use the Cray-specific tasking
   layer.


3) Set your CHPL_COMM environment variable to "ugni".

     export CHPL_COMM=ugni

   Muxed tasking is only available combined with ugni communications.
   Other Chapel environment variables having to do with runtime layers
   should be left unset.  Setting CHPL_TASKS and CHPL_COMM like this
   will cause the correct combination of other runtime layers that work
   with those to be selected automatically.


There are a few special parameters recognized by the muxed tasking
layer:

    Controlling the Call Stack Size
    -------------------------------

    For muxed tasking, more so than for other tasking implementations,
    it may be important to reduce the task call stack size from its
    default of 8 MiB.  A side effect of using the ugni communication
    layer is that task stacks have to be created at full size.  With
    other comm layers (or no comm layer), creating a stack just reserves
    the memory for it without actually bringing the pages of memory into
    existence.  The memory does not exist until each page of the stack
    is actually used.  If the stack limit is 8 MiB (the default) and
    2,000 tasks exist at the same time but each one only uses 32 KiB of
    its stack space, then the program only requires about 64 MiB (2000 *
    32 KiB) of memory for stacks.  But with ugni communications, the
    network interactions require that all the space be brought into
    existence up front.  So there, our hypothetical program would need
    16 GiB (2000 * 8 MiB) of heap space just for stacks.  Thus with ugni
    communications, in programs that may have many tasks active at once
    but where each one does not need a very large call stack (such as
    SSCA#2), it can be useful to make the stack size smaller than its
    default of 8 MiB.

    You can set the task stack size using CHPL_RT_CALL_STACK_SIZE, as
    described in README.executing.  The following would make the task
    stack size 128 KiB, for example:

      export CHPL_RT_CALL_STACK_SIZE=128k


    Stack Overflow Checking
    -----------------------

    With muxed tasking, the compiler --stack-checks setting specifies
    the default setting for execution-time stack overflow checking.
    Final control over stack overflow checks is provided by the
    CHPL_RT_STACK_CHECK_LEVEL environment variable, which can take the
    following values:
      0:  no stack overflow checking
      1:  limited stack overflow checking (default)
      2:  more stack overflow checking

    Due to the use of hugepages in the ugni comm layer, muxed tasking
    cannot use guard pages for stack overflow detection as fifo and
    qthreads tasking do.  So, overflow is detected by means of explicit
    checks against the task's stack limit, on entry to certain selected
    functions in the muxed tasking layer.  If overflow is seen, the
    runtime prints an error message and halts the program.  Successively
    higher levels (0, 1, 2) of overflow checking cause more overhead and
    correspondingly have more impact on performance.


    Number of Threads per Locale
    ----------------------------

    The muxed tasking layer gets the threads it uses as task execution
    vehicles from the soft-threads threading layer.  The soft-threads
    layer provides lightweight threads that can be switched rapidly.
    Chapel configuration constants allow you to control how many
    processor cores the soft-threads threading layer uses and the total
    number of lightweight threads it provides to the tasking layer.

    The CHPL_RT_NUM_HARDWARE_THREADS environment variable specifies the
    number of cores that should be used to run Chapel tasks on each
    locale.  The default is to use all of the cores, but if something
    other than the ability to run tasks limits performance, such as
    limited parallelism or doing many remote loads, reducing this may
    improve performance.  You can set CHPL_RT_NUM_HARDWARE_THREADS to
    any value from 1 to the actual number of hardware processor cores.
    For applications where the performance is dominated by the latency
    of small remote loads, such as the SSCA#2 benchmark and other graph
    processing codes, using 8 processor cores often gives better
    performance than using all of them.

    The CHPL_RT_NUM_THREADS_PER_LOCALE environment variable specifies
    the number of lightweight threads the soft-threads threading layer
    should provide to the muxed tasking layer for hosting tasks.  The
    default is the number of processor cores being used, which gives
    good performance in most cases.  However, if performance is limited
    by something other than on-node processor or bandwidth limits, and
    especially for applications like RA or SSCA#2 where performance is
    limited by network latency, it can be worthwhile to set this to as
    much as 16*the number of hardware threads (whether default or user
    specified).  You can set this to any value >= 0, but note that the
    soft-threads threading layer will silently limit it to >= 1 and <=
    32*the number of hardware threads.


Network Atomics
---------------

The Gemini(TM) and Aries(TM) networks support remote atomic memory
operations (AMOs) on XC, XE, and XK series systems.  When the CHPL_COMM
environment variable is set to "ugni", the following operations on
remote atomics are done using the network:

   read()
   write()
   exchange()
   compareExchange()
   add(), fetchAdd()
   sub(), fetchSub()
     32- and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer types, 32- and 64-bit
     floating point types.

   or(),  fetchOr()
   and(), fetchAnd()
   xor(), fetchXor()
     32- and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer types.

Note that on XE and XK systems, which have Gemini networks, out of the
above list only the 64-bit integer operations are done natively by the
network hardware.  32-bit integer and all floating point operations
are done with remote forks inside the ugni communication layer,
accelerated by Gemini hardware capabilities.

On XC systems, which have Aries networks, all of the operations shown
above are done natively by the network hardware.

Known Constraints and Bugs
--------------------------

* Our PBS launcher explicitly supports PBS Pro, Moab/Torque, and the
  NCCS site versions of PBS.  It may also work with other versions.
  If our PBS launcher does not work for you, you can fall back on a
  more manual launch of your program.  For example:

  - Launch the a.out_real binary manually using aprun and your own
    qsub script or command.

  - Use './a.out --generate-qsub-script' to generate a qsub script.
    Then edit the generated script and launch the a.out_real binary
    manually as above.

* Redirecting stdin when executing a Chapel program under PBS/qsub
  may not work due to limitations of qsub.

* GASNet targets multiple network "conduits" as the underlying
  communication mechanism.  On certain platforms, the Chapel build
  will use the 'mpi' conduit as the default.  As a result of using the
  mpi conduit, you may see a GASNet warning message at program start
  up.  To squelch this message, you can set the environment variable
  GASNET_QUIET=yes.

* There is a known GASNet build issue when using the gemini or aries
  conduits with hugepage support that results in link errors due to
  multiply defined symbols in the hugetlbfs library.  The workaround
  is to make sure that you do not have any craype-hugepages* module
  loaded when you compile and link a Chapel program while using the
  GASNet communication layer.  You may load a hugepage module when
  running the Chapel program.

* For X-series systems, there is a known issue with the Cray MPI
  release that causes some programs to assert and then hang during
  exit.  A workaround is to set the environment variable,
  MPICH_GNI_DYNAMIC_CONN to 'disabled.'  Setting this environment
  variable affects all MPI programs, so remember to unset it after
  running your Chapel program.

* The amount of memory available to a Chapel program running over
  GASNet with the gemini and aries conduits is allocated at program
  start up.  The default memory segment size may be too high on some
  platforms, resulting in an internal Chapel error or a GASNet
  initialization error such as:

     node 1 log gasnetc_init_segment() at /path/to/chapel/third-party/gasnet/GASNet-1.22.0/gemini-conduit/gasnet_gemini.c:562: MemRegister segment fault 8 at  0x2aab6ae00000 60000000, code GNI_RC_ERROR_RESOURCE

  If your Chapel program exits with such an error, try setting the
  environment variable CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE or GASNET_MAX_SEGSIZE to a
  lower value than the default (say 1G) and re-running your program.
  For more information, refer to the discussion of CHPL_RT_MAX_HEAP_SIZE
  above and/or the discussion of GASNET_MAX_SEGSIZE here:

     $CHPL_HOME/third-party/gasnet/GASNet-*/README

NCCS user notes
---------------

* NCCS Cray systems use a different qsub mechanism in order to
  enforce their queuing policies.  We have attempted to make our
  pbs-aprun launch code work with this version of qsub, but require a
  CHPL_LAUNCHER_ACCOUNT environment variable to be set to specify your
  NCCS account name.  For example:

    export CHPL_LAUNCHER_ACCOUNT=MYACCOUNTID

* NCCS users either need to specify 'debug' as their queue or set an
  explicit wall clock time limit using the mechanisms described above.
