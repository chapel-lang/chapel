reStructuredText
----------------

We have initiated an effort to translate our text based README files in to
reStructuredText; these can be detected by the suffix ".rst" in the filename.
These files are reasonably easy to read as conventional text
but you may prefer to read them using a reStructuredText viewer.

There are several viewers available for download. Alternatively you might
like to view the reST files using your browser and our Github respository;
reST files are rendered as nicely formatted HTML automatically.

You can navigate to the root of the documentation for this release using
the URL
