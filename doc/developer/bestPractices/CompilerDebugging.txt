Tips On Debugging The Compiler
==============================

See also: CompilerIRTricks.txt; notes on the generated code.
See also: compiler overview in $CHPL_HOME/doc/developer/compilerOverview.

With --print-passes, the compiler prints individual passes as they progress.

We typically debug the compiler with gdb.


Starting GDB and Setup
----------------------

* the easiest:  chpl --gdb <other compiler argument as usual>

  This fires up gdb and sets it up with useful shortcuts
  (by reading in $CHPL_HOME/compiler/etc/gdb.commands).

* traditional:  gdb $CHPL_HOME/bin/$CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM/chpl

* from within emacs:  M-x gdb <enter>
  then provide the path to 'chpl', e.g. /users/vass/chapel/bin/linux64/chpl

  This engages emacs's "gud" mode, providing e.g. convenient access
  to compiler source code at breakpoints/stepping/stack unwinding
  and browsing/searching convenience of an emacs buffer.

Unless you start with 'chpl --gdb', you need to set up gdb by hand.
Place the following in your ~/.gdbinig:

###########
# short for "set up for chapel"
define schp
 echo setting for Chapel in $arg0 \n
 set environment CHPL_HOME $arg0         # needed if not already in environment
 set environment CHPL_DEVELOPER 1        # ditto
 source $arg0/compiler/etc/gdb.commands  # done automatically by 'chpl --gdb'
 sdirs $arg0
 end

# needed (I think) only for debugging the generated code
define sdirs
 directory $arg0/modules/internal
 directory $arg0/modules/standard
 directory $arg0/modules/dists
 directory $arg0/modules/layouts
 end
###########

then call 'schp' from the gdb prompt (do not use ~ or $CHPL_HOME), e.g.:

(gdb) schp /users/vass/chapel
setting for Chapel in /users/vass/chapel 
(gdb) 

(Advanced: create a shortcut for this command, for faster typing.)


Other Useful Shortcuts/Setup
----------------------------

Here are some other useful additions to your ~/.gdbinit:

###########
set print pretty
set print object on
set unwindonsignal on
###########

'set print object on' makes gdb print a C++ object based on its
dynamic, rather than static, type. E.g. if the variable 'p' has the
(static) type Expr*, then 'print *p' in gdb will include the fields
corresponding to whatever subclass of Expr 'p' is pointing to at the
moment (e.g. DefExpr, SymExpr, etc.).


AST Viewing And Other Compiler Helper Functions
-----------------------------------------------

They are defined mostly in compiler/AST/view.cpp
with corresponding shortcuts in compiler/etc/gdb.commands:

legend: C function # gdb shortcut  # comment

print_view(BaseAST*)  # view, vi    # not showing ID
nprint_view(BaseAST*) # nview, nv
iprint_view(int id)   # iview, iv   # for the given ID
list_view(BaseAST*)   # lview, lv   # looks somewhat like Chapel code
  various ways to print out the AST subtree at the given node

viewFlags(Symbol*)    # flags
  prints the flags set on this Symbol

BaseAST::stringLoc()  # loc
  prints the ast's location in the source code

printCallStack()
  prints the source code call stack leading to the part of the program where
  the compiler is currently working, esp. during name/function resolution (?)


Other Tips
----------

(gdb) lv userModules.v[0]
  prints the entire user module
  can search the output for a symbol name or ast ID
  if multiple user modules, do .v[1] etc. (right?)

(gdb) break normalize
  stop right before the normalization pass

(gdb) break checkNormalized
  stop right after the normalization pass

gdbShouldBreakHere()
  compiler/etc/gdb.commands sets a breakpoint on this function

  E.g. it is invoked when a compiler emits an error (or is about to die
  for another reason) and for --break-on-id.
  You can call it in your debugging instrumentation as well.
