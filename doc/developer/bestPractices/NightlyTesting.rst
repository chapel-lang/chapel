Nightly Testing
===============

This is intended to help get external developers running nightly testing. The
following script should be called from a cron job or something to kick off the
testing regularly. This script basically groups all the env vars you'll need to
set into one place and handles downloading the chapel repo for testing. It then
calls our `nightly` script which runs a set of tests and mails results to a
provided list. It keeps these nightly logs so it can track new or resolved
regressions. The nightly script basically builds the compiler and runtime, runs
some tests and parses the test output to send mails. By default it will do a
correctness run, though it can also be configured to test performance, compiler
performance, memleaks, and several other configurations.

In the following script you'll need to set whatever special CHPL_* vars are
required for your testing and at a minimum `CHPL_NIGHTLY_CRON_RECIPIENT` and
`CHPL_NIGHTLY_TEST_CONFIG_NAME`. There are additional configuration variables
that can be set, but they have pretty sane defaults so they can probably be
left alone.

To test this script without running the entire test suite, you can simply run
this script with ``-hellos``. i.e. if the script is named "test_chapel" then::

    ./test_chapel -hellos

will only test the 6 hello*.chpl examples instead of the whole suite. If that
is successful the script can simply be called without any args and it will do a
correctness test on the entire chapel test suite::

    ./test_chapel

    # This is a script to help external developers run nightly testing. It
    # essentially downloads a copy of the chapel repo and sets some required
    # variables and then runs our "nightly" script. Any arguments are passed
    # along to the nightly script. See $CHPL_HOME/util/cron/nightly for
    # available options.
