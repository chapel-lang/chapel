Subversion repositories
=======================

Repository
------------
The subversion repository for the project is set up as follows:

* URL: svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/chapel/code
         branches/
           collaborations/     -- used for external collaborators
           release/            -- used to capture release branches
         tags/                 -- used to tag releases
         third-party-norelease -- third party code not yet intended for release
         trunk/                -- our main development branch ($CHPL_HOME)

* Anyone can read the repository.

* To commit to the repository, you need a SourceForge account and
  permissions granted by a Chapel administrator.  If you are not a
  Cray employee, a contributor's agreement is required to obtain
  commit privileges.  Different versions of the form exist for
  students and government employees.  The forms can be found in
  $CHPL_HOME/doc/developer/contributorAgreements

* Most external collaborations of any scope will be encouraged to work
  in a project-specific branch in the branches/collaborations/ space.


External Contributor Notes
--------------------------
In general, external contributors should work using the following
guidelines, which are designed to protect the core Chapel team's
ability to make forward progress and meet their contractual
requirements:

* Recall that commits to subversion are extremely difficult to remove
  from the source tree's history, so be very careful not to commit
  anything that you will regret later.

* Please avoid committing third-party source code to any part of the
  repository without clearing it with a member of the core Chapel
  team.

* Commit changes to your branch as often as you find worthwhile; when
  committing merges of trunk/ into your branch, please try to minimize
  the number of commits required in order to avoid creating too much
  noise for developers or users who may be tracking the commits
  through email or RSS feeds.

* Most commits to trunk/ should be done with someone on the main
  development team in the loop in order to avoid stepping on toes.  If
  you have changes in your branch that you believe are ready and
  worthwhile to migrate to trunk, please work with someone on the main
  development team to review the changes and approve their inclusion.

* Adding new tests or future tests to trunk/test can generally be done
  without prior approval; just be sure that the tests work well within
  the testing system and that they are sorted into a reasonable
  location in the test hierarchy.

* Other improvements, such as fixes to the documentation or vim/emacs
  highlighting modes, are also valued.  Minor changes can be committed
  to trunk/ without review; more major changes should get approval
  from the core team as with code changes.
