Git "cheat sheet" (with comparisons to svn)
===========================================

See ContributorInfo.txt for more information about the process
of contributing code to Chapel. The basic workflow is:
 - Let the Chapel community know about any long-term or big efforts
 - Use GitHub to fork the Chapel project
 - Create a feature branch
 - Develop your contribution locally
 - Update your feature branch with changes from the main Chapel project
 - Test your feature
 - Push your work to your feature branch
 - Create a pull request and work with your reviewers
 - When satisfied, your reviewer accepts your pull request

Additional docs available online at: http://git-scm.com/docs/

Git help pages can be viewed with:

.. code-block:: bash

    git help <command>

Update to HEAD: (this is what you'll typically want to use)

.. code-block:: bash

    git pull

    # or:
    git fetch origin
    git merge origin/master # replace master with whatever branch you're on

    # similar to:
    svn update

Update to specific revision number:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout <commit sha1>

    # similar to:
    svn update -r<revision number>

Create and switch to a feature branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout -b <branch_name>

Push your changes to your feature branch on GitHub:

.. code-block:: bash

    git push origin <branch_name>

Stage a file/dir for commit:
(you probably want to be on a feature branch first)

.. code-block:: bash

    git add path/to/file

    # (sort of) similar to:
    svn add path/to/file

Delete a file/dir and stage the change for commit:

.. code-block:: bash

    git rm [-r] path/to/dir/or/file

    # similar to:
    svn delete path/to/dir/or/file

Move a file/dir:

.. code-block:: bash

    git mv orig/path/a.txt new/path/to/b.txt

    # similar to:
    svn move orig/path/a.txt new/path/to/b.txt

Copy a file/dir and stage target for commit:

.. code-block:: bash

    cp <src> <target>
    git add <target>

    # similar to:
    svn copy <src> <target>

Get the status of files/dirs (staged and unstaged):

.. code-block:: bash

    git status

    # similar to:
    svn status

Get the diff of unstaged changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    git diff

    # similar to:
    svn diff

Get the diff of staged changes (those that were staged with ``git add``):

.. code-block:: bash

    git diff --cached

Backing out unstaged changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    git checkout path/to/file/a.txt

    # similar to:
    svn revert path/to/file/a.txt

Committing staged changes:

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit [-m <message>]

    # similar to:
    svn commit [-m <message>]

Fixing a commit message:

.. code-block:: bash

    git commit --amend

.. note::

    This should only every be done to commits that **have not been pushed** to
    a remote repository.

Synchronizing feature branch with master:

.. code-block:: bash

    # with feature branch checked out:
    git merge [--no-ff] origin/master

If there are conflicts, you will be asked to resolve them. Once the affected
files have been fixed, stage them with ``git add``, and then call ``git
commit`` to finish the merge process.


Bring in changes from the main Chapel project to your feature branch:

.. code-block:: bash

    git fetch upstream
    git merge upstream/master


Contribute a feature branch to the main Chapel project:

After pushing your changes to your feature branch on GitHub,
use the GitHub web interface to create a pull request.
Visit https://github.com/<username>/chapel, navigate
to your feature branch, and click the green Create Pull
Request button. Your contribution will need to be tested and
reviewed, and you will have to have signed a contributors
agreement. See ContributorInfo.txt.

Initial Git Setup
-----------------

Follow the GitHub directions to setup a new account.

  https://help.github.com/categories/53/articles

If you plan to use ssh to push/pull, setup SSH keys.

  https://help.github.com/categories/56/articles

Use the GitHub web interface to create a fork of the Chapel
repo by visiting https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel
and clicking the 'Fork' button. Then configure your local
git and check out your fork:

Here is the uncommented version of the commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    git config --global user.name 'Thomas Van Doren'
    git config --global user.email 'thomas@example.com'

    # linux/mac
    git config --global core.autocrlf input

    # windows
    git config --global core.autocrlf true

    # If using ssh keys, verify access to github. It should respond with a
    # message including your github username.
    ssh git@github.com

    # Clone your fork of the chapel repo!
    git clone git@github.com:<github_username>/chapel.git

    # Or, if using HTTPS instead of SSH.
    git clone https://github.com/<github_username>/chapel.git

    # Set up remotes for github
    cd chapel
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel.git
    # Make sure it works, get up-to-date without modifying your files
    git fetch upstream
