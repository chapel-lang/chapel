Chapel Contributor Agreements
=============================

This directory contains Chapel's Apache 2.0 contributor license
agreements (CLAs).  All contributors must submit completed CLAs prior
to contributing to the repository in order to help us maintain
Chapel's license terms.

There are two versions:

* [ICLA](chapel-icla.pdf) : This version is for contributors who are
  working on Chapel on their own.

* [CCLA](chapel-ccla.pdf): This version is for contributors associated
  with a corporation or other organization that can claim partial or
  complete ownership over their contributions.  In such cases, the
  appropriate party representing that entity must file a CCLA on the
  contributors' behalf.  This includes academic contributors who are
  working on Chapel as part of their job or funded research.

Once completed, CLAs should be scanned as PDFs and mailed to:
