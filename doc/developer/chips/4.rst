This Chapel Improvement Proposal records the last proposal for updated
constructor syntax and semantics.  This is the proposal that was presented at a
deep dive on 2014-12-09 with some changes based on feedback.

2012-06-?? hilde and vass complete a first draft


Rationale
---------

Improvement of automated memory management (AMM) in Chapel forces a distinction
between initialization and assignment.  In a constructor, relying on
default-initialization of fields followed by assignment is inefficient.  Adding
syntax for explicit field initialization removes that inefficiency.  This optimization is
expanded to include variable declarations as well.
The specification and implementation of ``const``-ness with respect to
objects and their fields is simplified.

A further goal of this proposal is to clarify the semantics of
initialization for objects of derived types.  Some programs compiled with the current
implementation exhibit undesirable behavior.  Stating the expected behavior clearly is a
first step toward replacing the current behavior with more reasonable semantics.

Two brief examples follow, to briefly show the differences between existing and proposed
constructors.  A further example follows, to show the undesirable behavior this
proposal seeks to correct.

Example -- Existing Syntax and Semantics
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An example of how a record constructor is currently written::

   record R {
     var i = 10;
     var r:real;
     var b:bool;

     proc R(s:real) {
       r = s;
     }
   }
   
   var t = new R(7.0);
   writeln(t);         // Prints: "(i = 10, r = 7.0, b = false)".


The above code declares a record of type ``R`` containing a constructor.  The constructor
accepts a real argument that is used to set the value of the ``r`` field.  Execution of
the declaration of ``t`` causes ``t`` to be associated with a record whose ``i`` field contains
the value "10", ``r`` field contains the value "7.0" and the ``b`` field is "false".  

In more detail, an unnamed temporary record is created and default-initialized as follows:  The ``i``
field receives the value "10", which is the field-default specified in the record
declaration; since no default value is specified for the ``r`` field, the type-default
value for type ``real`` "0.0" is used; similarly, the default value of ``bool`` "false"
is used to initialize field ``b``.  The body of the constructor is then entered.  The
value of field ``r`` is replaced by the value of ``s`` -- whatever value was passed as the
argument of the corresponding constructor call.  In this case, ``s`` is "7.0", so that is
the final value of the ``r`` field in the unnamed temporary.  The value of the
temporary is then bitwise-copied into the space reserved for ``t``.  

The problem with the above syntax is that the ``=`` in the body of the constructor must be
treated as assignment.  This is because there is no syntactical way to distinguish initializations
from assignment statements in that context.  

If ``s`` is to be assigned to ``r``, that
means that ``r`` must already have been initialized before the body of the constructor is
entered.  This means that all of the fields in an object must be initialized before the
body of one of its constructors is run.

In the current implementation, that is what happens: each field in a record or class being
constructed is first default-initialized; then, the statements in the body of the
constructor are executed.  Statements in the constructor body may then overwrite the
default field values with other values.

If the fields are of fairly simple types, then this default-initialization followed by
assignment is not so bad.  But when the types are complex or the assignment operator
expensive, then it adversely affects performance.


Example -- Proposed Syntax and Semantics
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An example of how a record constructor would be written under this proposal::

   record R {
     var i = 10;
     var r:real;
     var b:bool;

     proc R(s:real)
     init(r = s) {}
   }

   var t = new R(7.0);
   writeln(r);         // Prints: "(i = 10, r = 7.0, b = false)".

The user-visible semantics of this example are the same as for the one above.  However,
there are two important differences in the implementation.  The ``=`` appearing in the
``init`` clause causes field ``r`` to be *initialized* with the value ``s``.  This
replaces the default-initialization of ``r`` followed by assignment from ``s`` with a
simple copy-initialization from ``s``.  The syntax for the initialization of ``t`` remains
the same, but the initialization is performed in-place, so the above bitwise copy is avoided.

In more detail, space for ``t`` is allocated.  The constructor is then invoked on ``t`` as a
method.  It first executes the ``init`` clause.  This clause causes field ``t.r`` to be
initialized using the value of ``s``.  After all explicit field initializations appearing
in the ``init`` clause have been executed, the uninitialized fields in ``t`` are
initialized in lexical order (according to the order in which they appear in the
declaration of ``record R``).  The first such field is ``i``.  Since a field-default value
of "10" is supplied, that value is used to initialize ``i``.  Since ``r`` has already been
initialized, it is skipped.  Since there is no field-default value for ``b``, it is
initialized using its type-default value "false".  Then, control is transferred to the
body of the constructor, which in this case is empty.  Since ``t`` is initialized
in-place, no bitwise copy is required after construction.


Example -- Existing Undesirable Behavior
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The following code::

   class C {
     var x: int;
     proc myfunc() { x = 1; }
     proc C() { myfunc(); }
   }
   
   class SubC : C {
     proc myfunc() { x = 2; };
   }

   var myc = new C();
   writeln(myc);
   var mysubc = new SubC();
   writeln(mysubc);

is expected to produce::

   {x = 1}
   {x = 2}

or::

   {x = 1}
   {x = 1}

but instead outputs::

   {x = 1}
   {x = 0}

The rationale for the expected output is that the default initialization of an
object of type ``SubC`` should first perform default-initialization on its
base-class sub-object.  This would entail calling the zero-argument constructor
defined in ``class C``.  If the object being initialized has acquired its
dynamic type by that point in execution, then the call to myfunc() in the
constructor for ``C`` would dispatch to SubC.myfunc() and the value of its ``x``
field would be set to 2.  Otherwise, since the static type of the base-class
object is C, it would dispatch to C.myfunc().  In that case, the value of the
object's ``x`` field would be set to 1.  In no case should it be set to 0.

According to the current proposal, although dynamically-bound (polymorphic)
functions can be invoked in the body of a constructor, the dynamic type of an
object is not acquired until execution of is initializer list is complete.  That
means that initialization of the base-class sub-object will use the static type
of the base-class sub-object when dispatching to any methods called in the body of any of base-class
constructor.  That means that we will end up with the second behavior: Both base-
and derived-class objects will end up with their ``x`` fields initialized to 1.


Description
-----------

The proposal is to add field-initializer syntax and semantics to the Chapel
language.  It clarifies the order of initialization of fields -- including
initialization of base-class sub-objects -- and describes when ``const``
declarations (implying immutability) apply to the fields in an object and to the
object as a whole.

This proposal is a summary of the current state of the proposal based on
feedback on the previous proposal, presented to the group on a deep dive on
December 9 last year.  The previous proposal may be found in the source tree at
https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/spec/proposals/constructors.

For simplicity, this ChIP contains only the main proposal; support
for ``noinit`` initialization is handled in a separate ChIP [reference to be supplied].

The details of the proposal are given below, and restated briefly in the :ref:`summary` section.

.. _variables:

Variable Declaration Semantics
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The syntax for variable declarations remains unchanged from the current specification.
However, the distinction between initialization and assignment offered in this proposal
requires a clarification of the *semantics* of variable initialization in light of that
distinction.

Given a declaration with an initializer::

   var r:R = <expr>;

The semantics of the current implementation are to first create and default-initialize the
variable ``r``.  The initialization expression is evaluated and its value copied into the
named variable ``r`` by assignment.  In the context of a variable declaration, ``=`` means
"assignment".  So the above declaration is exactly equivalent to::

   var r:R;    // r is default-initialized
   r = <expr>; // The value of <expr> is copied into r by assignment.

Here, we propose that in the context of a variable declaration, the ``=`` symbol be
treated as initialization instead.  That is, the above declaration statement should be
interpreted roughly as::

   pragma "noinit" var r:R; // Create space for r but don't initialize it.
   r.R(<expr>);             // Call a constructor on r.

This implementation does not use assignment.  Instead, it assumes the existence of a
constructor for type ``R`` that can bind to an argument of the type of ``<expr>``. [#]_
If the initialization expression is already of the same type as the variable (as, for
example, when the type of the variable is not stated explicitly), then copy-construction
will be used.

Under the proposal stated thus far, the syntax::

   var r = new R(<args>);

would imply that a temporary of type ``R`` is created and initialized by a call to
``R(<args>)``.  The resulting value would then be copied into ``r`` through
copy-construction.  (And finally, the temporary would be destroyed.)

We propose to take this a step further.  Since the constructor for the temporary
expression already operates on an object of type ``R`` it may as well operate on the
variable being declared.  In that special case, the temporary is not needed and one
copy-construction can be eliminated by invoking ``R(<args>)`` on ``r`` directly::

   pragma "noinit" var r:R; // Reserve some space for r.
   r.R(<args>);             // Initialize it by calling R(<args>).

This special case could be considered an optimization, but it isn't really:  It would have
observable effects within the program since it affects the number of times the
copy-constructor (or its equivalent) is called.  The recommendation is to leave
unspecified whether the copy-constructor is called in this case.


.. _syntax:

Constructor Declaration Syntax
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In the current proposal, a constructor is introduced using the "C++" style: It
is a normal procedure declaration whose name matches the name of a (class or
record) type (the *subject type*) in scope at the point of declaration. [#]_  A
constructor may contain a field-initializer clause.  At present, the syntax for
a constructor is the same as for a procedure or method declaration, as given
by::

   procedure-declaration-statement:
     linkage-specifier[OPT] `proc' function-name argument-list[OPT] return-intent[OPT] return-type[OPT] where-clause[OPT] function-body
   method-declaration-statement:
     linkage-specifier[OPT] proc-or-iter this-intent[OPT] type-binding function-name argument-list[OPT] return-intent[OPT] return-type[OPT] where-clause[OPT] function-body

According to the proposal, the syntax would be augmented by the addition of an
optional field-initializer-clause::
  
   procedure-declaration-statement:
     linkage-specifier[OPT] `proc' function-name argument-list[OPT] return-intent[OPT] return-type[OPT] where-clause[OPT] field-initializer-clause[OPT] function-body
   method-declaration-statement:
     linkage-specifier[OPT] proc-or-iter this-intent[OPT] type-binding function-name argument-list[OPT] return-intent[OPT] return-type[OPT] where-clause[OPT] field-initializer-clause[OPT] function-body

It is illegal for a non-constructor method to contain a
``field-initializer-clause``.  Because a special keyword is not used to
introduce a constructor, it is impossible to distinguish between normal
procedure declarations and constructor declarations (and respectively between
normal method declarations versus method constructor declarations) based on
syntax alone.  Parser production code or downstream processing must be employed
to enforce this constraint.

The rest of the required syntax is supplied by productions that render the
``field-initializer-clause`` in terms of previously-defined language elements
(consult the Syntax chapter in the `Chapel Specification <http://chapel.cray.com/spec/spec-0.97.pdf` for their definitions)::

   field-initializer-clause:
     `init' ( field-initializer-list )
     `init' = constructor-call-expression

   field-initializer-list:
     field-initializer
     field-initializer-list , field-initializer

   field-initializer:
     field-name = expression
     field-name
     variable-declaration

   field-name:
     identifier

   pseudo-field-name:
     identifier
 
   constructor-call-expression:
     call-expression

In the first form of ``field-initializer-clause``, the ``init`` keyword is used
to introduce the list of field-initializers.  The list of field-initializers is
comma-separated and enclosed in parentheses.  Each field-name must name a
``var`` or ``const`` field in the base type of the constructor, or be
``super``.  

If a ``variable-declaration`` appears in
the ``field-initializer-list``, it creates a pseudo-field.  A pseudo-field can
be useful for capturing intermediate results, e.g. to initialize two different
fields to the same value -- the calculation of which is nontrivial.

In the second form, the ``init`` keyword is followed by an ``=`` followed by a
constructor call expression.  The name of constructor must match the name of the
subject type.  The second form allows one constructor to invoke another.  It
takes the place of a normal initializer list. [#]_


.. _semantics:

Constructor Declaration Semantics
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A constructor is a method on an object of the subject type.  When execution of a
constructor begins, the object (``this``) is in an uninitialized state (hence
all of its fields are also uninitialized).  Execution of the constructor
proceeds by first executing the ``field-initializer-clause`` and then executing the body of
the constructor.  

Execution of the ``field-initializer-clause`` proceeds by executing each of the
``field-initializer`` in lexical order.  In the form containing an ``=``, the
expression is evaluated and its value is used to initialize the corresponding
field in the object, as if by a constructor call.  These semantics are intended to be the
same as for initialization in the context of a variable declaration, as discussed above in
:ref:`variables`.  In the form containing just a
``field-name``, the field is initialized using the default-initializer supplied
in the field declaration, if present.  Otherwise, it is initialized using the
default value corresponding to its type.

The keyword ``super`` refers to the base-class sub-object.  The ``super`` field
behaves like any other field in the class. [#]_  A pseudo-field behaves like a normal
variable declaration.  The variable introduced by a pseudo-field remains in
scope until the end of the constructor body.

After all ``field-initializer`` expressions have
been processed, any fields in the object that remain uninitialized are
initialized in order of their appearance in the class or record declaration.
Each such initialization uses the value of ``initialization-part`` if present.
Otherwise, the field is initialized to the default value of the corresponding
type.  It is an error if neither a ``type-part`` nor an ``initialization-part``
is supplied in such declarations.

The expression appearing in a ``field-initializer`` may be arbitrarily complex.  It
may refer to global variables and to formal arguments in the constructor's
formal argument list.  However,
it is illegal for the expression in a ``field-initializer`` to refer to a value
that has not yet been initialized. [#]_ [#]_

The semantics of a constructor body are the same as the semantics of a method.
All fields of the subject type may be referred to implicitly, or explicitly
using ``this``.  Methods on ``this`` may be invoked using either explicit or
implicit syntax.  Because it is valid to call methods on ``this`` within the body of a
constructor, there is no reason to have a special ``initialize()`` function that is called
automatically if present.  The class designer can create arbitrarily-named initialization
helper functions -- even those taking arguments and returning values other than ``void``.
These must unfortunately be invoked explicitly, but that brings the advantage that those
initialization helpers become less hidden.


.. _inheritance:

Inheritance
+++++++++++

The syntax and semantics related to the ``super`` field are discussed above.
Mention of the ``super`` field in any user-defined class or record type is
always valid, since every class type derives from ``object`` and every record
type derives from ``value``.  

Since the subject type of a constructor is known at compile time, the type of
``super`` is also known at compile time (being the immediate base type of the
subject type).  Therefore, dispatches to ``super`` in a ``field-initializer-clause``
or constructor body need not be dispatched dynamically.  Likewise, in the body
of a constructor, the type of ``this`` is known at compile-time.  Therefore,
methods on this may be bound statically.

On the other hand, a constructor may arrange to pass ``this`` to a 
method while obscuring the static type of ``this`` by casting it to a base-class
type.  In that case, the method will be bound dynamically using the run-time
type of ``this``.  The dynamic type of ``this`` is established after processing
of the ``field-initializer-clause`` is complete, including the default
initialization of any fields not mentioned explicitly.  The dynamic type is set
equal to the subject type. [#]_


.. _const_ness:

Const-ness
++++++++++

A field declared to be ``const`` becomes immutable after it has been
initialized. [#]_  When a constructor is used to initialize an object that is
declared to be ``const``, the object as a whole (including any fields of
``this`` that are not declared to be ``const``) are mutable until
that constructor returns control to the caller.  Thereafter, the fields in that
object are all immutable.


.. _constructor_calls:

Constructor Calls
+++++++++++++++++

Given that an object being constructed should be in an uninitialized state, it should be
illegal to invoke a constructor on an object that has already been initialized.  According
to this proposal, the following code should generate a (compile-time) error::

   var r:R;     // Default-initialized, for example.
   ...
   r.R(<args>); // Illegal.

Constructor invocations involving ``new`` as described in the specification would still be
legal and retain the same semantics as are currently described there.  Invocation of a
constructor in the context of a variable initialization for field initialization will have the
semantics described above in :ref:`variables`.


.. _implementation:

Implementation Notes
++++++++++++++++++++

This proposal is primarily about the syntax and semantics of constructors --
approaching the subject from the user's perspective.  However, such a
description also influences how the requisite semantics are implemented.

In the above section on :ref:`semantics`, constructors are introduced as
methods.  That means that they have an implicit ``this`` variable that refers to
the object being constructed and they do not return a value.  This is consistent
with the semantics currently implemented.

The current implementation achieves these semantics in a somewhat roundabout
manner -- first creating an unnamed temporary object, initializing this by a
method call, and then transferring the contents of that object through a bitwise
copy into the space allocated for the named variable.

Although this proposal does not directly rely upon it, its recommendation is to
rework the implementation code so that constructor calls do, in fact, operate
like methods.  When that is done, the code::

   var t = new R(7.0);

will effectively be implemented as::

   pragma "noinit" var t; // Reserve some space for t on the stack.
   t.R(7.0);              // Call a constructor on t, passing 7.0 as an argument.

The basic change required in the implementation is to move the allocation
outside of what is currently a constructor function (not a method) and then
rework constructor functions to be methods instead.  

This change should have no user-visible effect at the behavioral level.  At the
meta-behavioral level (performance and resource usage), the difference should be
observable as faster execution and a smaller run-time memory footprint.  Some of
the implementation code should also be simpler.


.. _summary:

Summary
+++++++

The main syntactical and semantical provisions of this proposal are summarized as:

* Variable initialization should treat ``=`` as initialization (i.e. a constructor call),
  not as assignment.

* A ``field-initialization-clause`` will be added to the syntax for constructors.

  - The added syntax will consist of an introductory keyword followed by a list of
    initializer expressions enclosed in parentheses.  

  - Each initializer must bind to
    one of the fields declared in the constructor's object (class or record) type.

  - Each initializer provides a value to be used to initialize the corresponding
    field. 

  - The field being initialized must be named.  

  - The actual initialization order is
    the order of appearance of initializer list.  

  - Class- or record-default
    initializers will be used if the initializer list does not supply a value.

  - Default values may be used explicitly by naming the field without
    supplying a value.  

  - Pseudo-initializers may be used to capture results in an
    initializer list.

  - A constructor call may be used place of a field initializer list.

* The fields and methods of ``this`` may be accessed within the body of a constructor.

* The special ``initialize()`` function is deprecated.

* Fields declared to be ``const`` become immutable after they have been
  initialized and before the body of the constructor is entered.  

* Objects declared
  to be ``const`` become immutable after the constructor has run to completion and
  control is returned to the point of invocation of the constructor.

* Direct invocation of a constructor (using method invocation syntax) should be illegal.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] If the concepts of coercion and construction are fused (as in C++) then argument
       coercion needs to be disabled in the context of a constructor call.  Otherwise,
       coercion chains could grow to arbitrary lengths, which is likely to lead to
       absurdities.

       If coercions are distinct from constructors, then it probably makes the most sense
       to use only copy-construction for initialization.  The initialization expression
       would need to be coercible to the target variable type.  It is unspecified whether
       copy-construction calls an actual constructor or is instead implemented as a
       bitwise copy followed by a call to a fixup (postblit) method.

.. [#] The idea of using a unique keyword such as ``ctor`` to introduce a
       constructor was discussed.  The keyword approach is useful for generic
       programming, because a constructor can be mentioned using a well-known
       name (such as ``__init__`` in Python).  The idea was abandoned for the
       sake of the current proposal because it did not obtain unanimous support.

.. [#] Any constructor for the subject type initializes all fields in an object
       of that type.  Since each field can be initialized only once, it would be
       illogical to include other field-initializers before or after a
       constructor call in a ``field-initializer-clause``.

.. [#] In particular, an initializer for ``super`` can appear anywhere in a
       ``field-initializer-clause`` or be omitted.  Once initialized, the fields
       of super may be referenced in other ``field-initializer`` expressions and
       methods of ``super`` may be invoked.  In this context, a reference to the
       ``super`` field is always explicit: it must be referred to using
       the name ``super``; it may not be referenced implicitly through ``this``.

.. [#] As a consequence, only the names of fields
       that precede the current ``field-initializer`` may appear
       anywhere in that ``field-initializer``'s expression.  In particular, the name of
       a field cannot appear in its own initializer expression.

.. [#] The object itself (``this``) is not fully initialized until after the
       initializer list has been processed in its entirety.  Therefore, it is illegal
       for the keyword ``this`` to appear anywhere in a ``field-initializer-clause``.

.. [#] In discussions, Vass expressed concerns about type-safety, given that any
       routine called from the initializer list or body of a constructor could
       publish the ``this`` object before it has been fully constructed.  There
       are three pieces that constitute this proposal's response to that
       concern:

       1. Since it is illegal to mention ``this`` in the initializer list, it
          cannot be published by any initialization expression appearing in the
          ``field-initializer-clause``.  The stricture against referring to ``this`` in
          that context also refers to implicit references.  That means that it is
          illegal to call a method of the subject type in the
          ``field-initializer-clause``, so ``this`` is prevented from escaping in
          that manner as well.
      
       2. The dynamic type of the object is not established until processing of the
          ``field-initializer-clause`` is complete.  It is not clear that the
          specification requires the base-class sub-object to be laid out in memory
          so that its starting address coincides with the starting address of the
          derived-class object.  It is also unclear whether the two share the same
          dynamic type field.  In the current implementation, they do not share the same
          starting address but they do share the same dynamic type field.
      
          The scenario of concern is if a base-class constructor attempts to
          publish the derived-class object before its initialization is complete.
          This would be accomplished through initialization of the ``super``
          field.  
      
          If the object being constructed shares its dynamic type field
          with the base-class sub-object, then within the body of the base class
          constructor the dynamic type of the ``super`` will be the type of the base class.
          An attempt to publish the object there will publish an
          object of base-class type.  Whether or not the object being constructed
          and the base-class object coincide in memory, only field accessors and
          methods applicable to the base type may be invoked: the compiler will not
          produce code that attempts in any way to access fields belonging uniquely
          (i.e. not through inheritance) to the object being constructed.  

          This remains true until the shared dynamic type field is updated after the
          object's ``field-initializer-clause`` is processed and before its body is
          entered.  If the base-class sub-object and the object itself do not coincide in
          memory, then the published object will still point to the base-class sub-object
          whose dynamic type has been updated to the derived-class object's type.  That
          would be bad; apparently our current implementation needs some re-thinking.  Of
          the four possibilities outlined above, ours is the only one guaranteed to fail.
          If the base-class sub-object and the object coincide and share their dynamic
          type field, then the object being constructed will exhibit behaviors associated
          with the derived type (i.e. the ability to access fields and invoke methods
          associated with that type) as soon as execution of its
          ``field-initializer-list`` is complete and before the body of its constructor
          has been entered.  
          If the base-class sub-object has its own type, then an object published
          by a base-class constructor will always be of the base type.  In that
          object layout scheme, there is no way to make a published ``this`` object
          exhibit dynamic type (polymorphic) behavior.
      
       3. Because it is considered to be fully-initialized at the beginning of a
          constructor body, the ``this`` object can be published anywhere in a
          constructor body.  The objection here might be that an object is not
          "blessed" as being fully constructed until the closing brace of the
          constructor is reached.
      
          A simple workaround is to require that any such publication be placed at
          the end of the constructor body.  A "virtual closing brace" exists at the
          point in the code at which all of the fields have values consistent with
          the invariants ascribed to a fully-constructed object of that class.
          Statements which appear after that virtual closing brace deal with the
          fully-constructed object, so it is OK for them to manipulate the object
          as a whole.  If the virtual closing brace does not exist, then the
          problem being addressed is a restatement of the Postman's Paradox.
      
          The stronger argument is that the point in the lifetime of the object at
          which it is safe to publish it is under the control of the class designer
          -- it is not a matter in which the language definition or the compiler
          can effectively or even desirably interfere.  It may be ready to publish
          at the very top of the constructor body -- subsequent changes being
          responded to dynamically by watchers on the published object.  It might
          not be ready to publish until several phases after its initial
          construction.  In which case, "avid" publication through the base-class
          constructor seems like a poor programming idiom.  All of this is best left to
          the class designer: aside from its effect on const-ness, there is nothing
          special about the closing brace of a constructor body.

.. [#] In particular, it cannot be modified in the body of the constructor.
