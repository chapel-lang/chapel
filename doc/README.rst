Chapel Documentation
====================

This directory contains Chapel's documentation in two formats:

``html/`` contains a web-rendered format of the documentation, which reflects
the online documentation hosted at ``https://chapel-lang.org/docs``. This can be
viewed by pointing a web browser of your choice to ``html/index.html``.

``rst/`` contains the documentation in the format of reStructuredText (rst), a
markup language. This documentation can be viewed with a text editor of your
choice.

Note that some files in ``rst/`` are written or generated for the purpose of
being rendered as HTML, such as the ``modules/`` and ``builtins/`` directory,
as well as the ``index.rst`` files. For this reason, we recommend browsing the
documentation in the web format.
