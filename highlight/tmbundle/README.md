Chapel Textmate bundle
======================

The Chapel Textmate bundle is primarily used for syntax highlighting Chapel
code on Github. It would be great if a Textmate user was willing to improve and
expand it, but for now the primary goal is to keep it up-to-date with keywords
and grammar changes.

The Textmate bundle was originally created by [bholt][0].

Updating Chapel bundle
----------------------

0. Fork and clone the [chapel-lang/chapel-tmbundle][1] repo.
0. Manually update the PList/XML in `Syntaxes/Chapel.tmLanguage` with whatever
   changes you need.
0. Test the changes, e.g. using JetBrains' [CLion][4] or another IDE that
   supports TextMate bundles.  Opening a copy of [lulesh][5] may be useful.
0. Open a PR for the chapel-tmbundle repo and follow the normal merge process.
0. That's it! The next time [github/linguist][2] is released, the changes will
   automatically be picked up.
