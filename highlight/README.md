Chapel highlighting/formatting support
======================================

This directory contains rudimentary support for code
coloring/formatting in emacs and vim.  See the README files in the
individual subdirectories for details on using the modes.

It also contains support for and/or pointers to other syntax
highlighting capabilities that Chapel supports.

Both the emacs and vim modes for Chapel were created by modifying
existing language formatting modes for the respective editors and are
therefore licensed according to the agreements of those packages
(i.e., the GPL for emacs and the VIM license for vim).  See the
LICENSE files in the emacs/ and vim/ subdirectories for details.
