=================
Chapel emacs mode
=================

This directory subtree contains emacs e-lisp files that perform simple
formatting of Chapel code.  Support for Chapel formatting with these
files is far from perfect, but far better than having no formatting at
all (we find).  Versions 22-24 are the main versions that we are
currently supporting. Thanks to Steve Balensiefer for providing the
initial version of the Chapel mode for these versions.
