NAME
  chpl - Compiler for the Chapel Programming Language

SYNOPSIS
  chpl [-O] [--no-checks] [--fast]
       [-g] [--savec directory]
       [-M directory...] [--main-module mod]
       [-o outfile] [options] source-files...

DESCRIPTION

  The chpl command invokes the Chapel compiler. chpl converts one or
  more Chapel source files into an executable. It does this by
  compiling Chapel code to C99 code and then invoking the target
  platform's C compiler to create the executable. However, most users
  will not need to be aware of the use of C as an intermediate format
  during compilation.

SOURCE FILES
  Chapel currently recognizes four source file types: .chpl, .c, .h and .o.

  foo.chpl      Chapel sources are compiled by the Chapel compiler into C intermediate code,
                which is then passed to the target compiler to be compiled into
                object code.

  foo.c         C source files are passed directly to the target C compiler.

  foo.h         C header files are included in the generated C code.

  foo.o         Object files are passed directly to the target linker. 

OPTIONS

  Module Processing Options

  --[no-]count-tokens    Prints the total number of static lexical tokens in 
                    the Chapel code files named on the command line.

  --main-module <module>   For programs that supply multiple possible entry
                     points (main() functions or module initializers that
                     can serve as an entry point), this option can be used 
                     to specify which module should serve as the starting 
                     point for program execution.

  -M, --module-dir <directory>   Add the specified directory to the module search 
                    path. See the description of $CHPL_MODULE_PATH in the 
                    ENVIRONMENT section of this man page for more details.

  --[no-]print-code-size    Prints out the size of the Chapel code files named
                    on the command line in great detail: For each code file, 
                    first the code is echoed back to the screen, prefixing 
                    each line with the number of lexical tokens it contains, 
                    or *C* if the line only contains comments, or *B* if the
                    line is blank. Next, the total number of tokens for the
                    file is printed. Then the number of lines is 
                    displayed, broken down into code lines, comment-only 
                    lines, and blank lines. Then the maximum and average 
                    number of tokens per line is displayed. Finally, a 
                    histogram of the number of tokens per line is shown.
                    After this information is printed for each file, a
                    grand total of the number of tokens across all the
                    files is displayed.

  --print-module-files   Prints the Chapel module source files parsed by
                    the Chapel compiler.

  --[no-]print-search-dirs   Print the module search path used to resolve module 'use'
                    statements. See the description of $CHPL_MODULE_PATH
                    in the ENVIRONMENT section of this man page for more 
                    details.

  Parallelism Control Options

  --[no-]local      Compile code for single/[multi-] locale execution,
                    changing on blocks to normal blocks, evaluating the
                    locale expression for side effects, and optimizing
                    away all remote references in the code. When $CHPL_COMM
                    is set to "none", --local is the default; otherwise
                    --no-local is the default.

  Optimization Control Options

  --baseline        Turns off all optimizations in the Chapel compiler and
                    generates naive C code with many temporaries.

  --cache-remote    Enables the cache for remote data. This cache can
                    improve communication performance for some programs by
                    adding aggregation, write behind, and read ahead. This
                    cache is not enabled by any other optimization options
                    such as --fast.
.
  --conditional-dynamic-dispatch-limit   When greater than zero, this
                    limit controls when the compiler will generate
                    code to handle dynamic dispatch with conditional
                    statements. If the number of possible method
                    calls is less than or equal to this limit, a
                    (possibly nested) conditional statement will be
                    used for dynamic dispatch instead of the virtual
                    method table. The default is zero.

  --[no-]copy-propagation   Enable [disable] copy propagation.

  --[no-]dead-code-elimination   Enable [disable] dead code elimination.

  --fast            Turns off all runtime checks using --no-checks, turns
                    on --no-ieee-float, -O and --specialize, and enables all
                    compiler optimizations in the rest of this section.
 
  --[no-]fast-followers   Enable [disable] the fast follower
                    optimization in which fast implementations of
                    followers will be invoked for specific leaders.

  --[no-]ieee-float   Disable [enable] optimizations that may affect IEEE
                    floating point conformance. The default is --ieee-float,
                    which ensures IEEE conformance.

  --[no-]loop-invariant-code-motion   Enable [disable] the optimization that
                    moves loop invariant code from loop runs into the loop's
                    "pre-header." By default invariant code is moved. This is
                    currently a rather conservative pass in the sense that 
                    it may not identify all code that is truly invariant.

  --[no-]ignore-local-classes   Disable [enable] local classes

  --[no-]inline     Enable [disable] function inlining.

  --[no-]inline-iterators   Enable [disable] iterator inlining. When
                    possible, the compiler optimizes the invocation of an
                    iterator in a loop header by inlining the
                    iterator's definition around the loop body.

  --[no-]live-analysis   Enable [disable] live variable analysis, which is
                    currently only used to optimize iterators that are
                    not inlined.

  --[no-]optimize-loop-iterators   Enable [disable] optimizations to
                    aggressively optimize iterators that are defined in terms
                    of a single loop. By default this is enabled.

  --[no-]optimize-on-clauses   Enable [disable] optimization of on
                               clauses in which qualifying on
                               statements may be optimized in the
                               runtime if supported by the $CHPL_COMM
                               layer.

  --optimize-on-clause-limit   Limit on the function call depth to allow
                    for on clause optimization. The default value is 20.

  --[no-]privatization   Enable [disable] privatization of distributed arrays
                    and domains if the distribution supports it.

  --[no-]remove-copy-calls   Enable [disable] removal of copy calls
                    (including calls to what amounts to a copy
                    constructor for records) that ensure Chapel
                    semantics but which can often be optimized away.

  --[no-]remote-value-forwarding   Enable [disable] remote value
                    forwarding of read-only values to remote threads
                    if reading them early does not violate program
                    semantics.

  --[no-]scalar-replacement   Enable [disable] scalar replacement of records
                    and classes for some compiler-generated data structures
                    that support language features such as tuples and
                    iterators.

  --scalar-replace-limit   Limit on the size of tuples being replaced during
                           scalar replacement. The default value is 8.

  --[no-]tuple-copy-opt   Enable [disable] the tuple copy optimization
                          in which whole tuple copies of homogenous
                          tuples are replaced with explicit assignment
                          of each tuple component.

  --tuple-copy-limit  Limit on the size of tuples considered for the
                      tuple copy optimization. The default value is 8.

  --[no-]use-noinit               Enable [disable] ability to skip default
                                  initialization through the keyword
                                  noinit

  Run-time Semantic Check Options

  --no-checks       Turns off many run-time checks, equivalent to:
                      --no-bounds-checks --no-nil-checks --no-local-checks
                      --no-stack-checks.
                    Currently, it is typically necessary to use this flag
                    (or --fast) in order to have any hope of achieving
                    performance competitive with hand-coded C or Fortran.

  --[no-]bounds-checks   Enable [disable] run-time bounds checking,
                    e.g. during slicing and array indexing.

  --[no-]local-checks  Enable [disable] run-time checking of the locality of
                    references within local blocks.

  --[no-]nil-checks   Enable [disable] run-time checking for accessing nil
                    object references.

  --[no-]stack-checks   Enable [disable] run-time checking for stack
                    overflow.

  --[no-]cast-checks   Enable [disable] run-time checks in safeCast calls for
                    casts that wouldn't preserve the logical value being cast.

  C Code Generation Options

  --[no-]codegen     Enable [disable] generating C code and the binary
                    executable. Disabling code generation is useful to reduce
                    compilation time, for example, when only Chapel compiler
                    warnings/errors are of interest.

  --[no-]cpp-lines   Causes the compiler to emit cpp #line directives
                    into the generated code in order to help map generated
                    C code back to the Chapel source code that it implements.
                    The [no-] version of this flag turns this feature off.

  --max-c-ident-len  Limits the length of identifiers in the generated code,
                    except when set to 0. The default is 0, except when
                    $CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER indicates a PGI compiler (pgi or
                    cray-prgenv-pgi), in which case the default is 1020.

  --[no-]munge-user-idents   By default, chpl munges all user
                    identifiers in the generated C code in order to
                    minimize the chances of conflict with an
                    identifier or keyword in C (in the current
                    implementation, this is done by appending '_chpl'
                    to the identifier). This flag provides the ability
                    to disable this munging. Note that whichever mode,
                    the flag is in, chpl may perform
                    additional munging in order to implement Chapel
                    semantics in C, or for other reasons.

  --savec <dir>      Saves the compiler-generated C code in the specified 
                    directory, creating the directory if it does not already
                    exist. This option may overwrite existing files in the
                    directory.

  C Code Compilation Options

  --ccflags <flags>   Add the specified flags to the C compiler command line
                     when compiling the generated code.

  -g, --[no-]debug  Causes the generated C code to be compiled with debugging
                    turned on. If you are trying to debug a Chapel program,
                    this flag is virtually essential along with the --savec
                    flag. This flag also turns on the --cpp-lines option
                    unless compiling as a developer (for example, via --devel).

  --dynamic  Use dynamic linking when generating the final binary.  If 
             neither --dynamic or --static are specified, use the
             backend compiler's default.

  -I, --hdr-search-path <dir>   Add dir to the back-end C compiler's search 
                     path for header files.

  --ldflags <flags>  Add the specified flags to the C compiler link line
                     when linking the generated code.

  -l, --lib-linkage <library>   Specify a C library to link in on the C 
                     compiler command line.

  -L, --lib-search-path <dir>   Specify a C library search path on the C
                     compiler command line.

  --make <make utility>   Specify the gmake-compatible utility that should be 
                    used when compiling the generated code.

  -O, --[no-]optimize  Causes the generated C code to be compiled with
                    [without] optimizations turned on. The specific set of
                    flags used by this option is platform-dependent; use the
                    --print-commands option to view the C compiler command
                    used. If you would like additional flags to be used with
                    the C compiler command, use the --ccflags option.

  --[no-]specialize  Causes the generated C code to be compiled with flags that
                     specialize the executable to the architecture that is
                     defined by CHPL_TARGET_ARCH. The effects of this flag will
                     vary based on choice of back-end compiler and the
                     value of CHPL_TARGET_ARCH.

  -o, --output <filename>   Specify the name of the compiler-generated
                     executable (defaults to a.out if unspecified).

  --static  Use static linking when generating the final binary.  If 
             neither --static or --dynamic are specified, use the
             backend compiler's default.

  LLVM Code Generation Options

  --[no-]llvm       Use LLVM as the code generation target rather than C. See
                    $CHPL_HOME/doc/technotes/README.llvm for details.

  --[no-]llvm-wide-opt   Enable [disable] LLVM wide pointer communication 
                    optimizations.
                    This option requires --llvm and packed wide pointers.
                    Packed wide pointers are enabled by setting
                    CHPL_WIDE_POINTERS = node16. You must also supply --fast
                    to enable wide pointer optimizations. This flag allows
                    existing LLVM optimizations to work with wide pointers -
                    for example, they might be able to hoist a 'get' out of a
                    loop. See $CHPL_HOME/doc/technotes/README.llvm for details.

  Documentation Options

  --[no-]docs       Create [Don't create] documents based on comments
                    preceding symbol declarations. See
                    $CHPL_HOME/doc/technotes/README.chpldoc for more
                    information.

  --[no-]docs-alphabetical  [Don't] Alphabetize the documentation within
                    each lexical scope rather than using the declaration
                    order within the code.

  --docs-comment-style <string>  Specify the opening comment character
                    sequence used to distinguish a documentation comment
                    from a normal one (defaults to '/*' if unspecified).

  --docs-dir <dirname>  Specify the directory name into which documentation
                    should be saved (defaults to 'docs' if unspecified).

  --docs-text-only  Specify that documents should use a text output file
                    format rather than HTML.

  --docs-save-sphinx <directory>  Save generated Sphinx project in
                                  directory.

  Compilation Trace Options

  --[no-]print-commands  Prints the system commands that the compiler 
                    executes in order to compile the Chapel program.

  --[no-]print-passes    Prints the compiler passes during compilation and the
                    amount of wall clock time required for the pass. After
                    compilation is complete two tables are produced that
                    provide more detail of how time is spent in each pass
                    (compiling, verifying, and memory management) and the
                    percentage of the total time that is attributed to each
                    pass. The first table is sorted by pass and the second
                    table is sorted by the time for the pass in descending
                    order.

  --print-passes-file <filename>   Saves the compiler passes and the amount of
                    wall clock time required for the pass to <filename>. An 
                    error is displayed if the file cannot be opened but no
                    recovery attempt is made. 

  Miscellaneous Options

  --[no-]devel       Puts the compiler into [out of] developer mode, which
                     takes off some of the safety belts, changes default
                     behaviors, and exposes additional undocumented
                     command-line options. Use at your own risk and direct any
                     questions to the Chapel team.

  --explain-call <call>[:<module>][:<line>]   Helps explain the function
                     resolution process for the named function by printing 
                     out the visible and candidate functions. Specifying 
                     a module name and/or line number can focus the
                     explanation to those calls within a specific module
                     or at a particular line number.

  --explain-instantiation <function|type>[:<module>][:<line>]   Lists
                     all of the instantiations of a function or type.
                     The location of one of possibly many points of
                     instantiation is shown. Specifying a module name
                     and/or line number can focus the explanation to
                     those calls within a specific module or at a
                     particular line number.

  --[no-]explain-verbose   In combination with explain-call or
                     explain-instantiation, causes the compiler to output more
                     debug information related to disambiguation.

  --instantiate-max <max>   In order to avoid infinite loops when
                     instantiating generic functions, the compiler
                     limits the number of times a single function
                     can be instantiated. This flag raises that
                     maximum in the event that a legal instantiation
                     is being pruned too aggressively.

  --[no-]print-callstack-on-error   Accompany certain error and warning
                     messages with the Chapel call stack that the compiler
                     was working on when it reached the error or warning
                     location. This is useful when the underlying cause
                     of the issue is in one of the callers.

  -s, --set <config param>[=<value>]   Overrides the default value of
                     a configuration parameter in the code. For
                     boolean configuration variables, the value can
                     be omitted, causing the default value to be toggled.

  --[no-]task-tracking  Enable [disable] the Chapel-implemented task tracking
                     table that supports the execution-time -b / -t flags.
                     This option is currently only useful when $CHPL_TASKS
                     is set or inferred to 'fifo' and adds compilation-time
                     overhead when it will not be used, so is off by default.

  --[no-]warn-const-loops  Enable [disable] warnings for 'while' loops
                     whose condition is a 'const' variable, because such
                     a loop condition is likely unintended.  'While' loops
                     with 'param' conditions do not trigger this warning.

  --[no-]warn-special  Enable [disable] all special compiler warnings
                     issued due to syntax and other language
                     changes. Currently, these include
                     --[no-]warn-domain-literal and
                     --[no-]warn-tuple-iteration.

  --[no-]warn-domain-literal  Enable [disable] compiler warnings
                     regarding the potential use of the old-style
                     domain literal syntax (e.g. [1..2, 3..4]). All
                     array literals with range elements will result in
                     warnings.

  --[no-]warn-tuple-iteration  Enable [disable] compiler warnings
                     regarding the potential use of old-style
                     zippering syntax. All uses of tuple iteration
                     will produce warnings.

  --no-warnings      Turns off compiler warnings.

  Compiler Information Options

  --copyright     Print the compiler's copyright information.

  -h, --help      Print a list of the command line options, indicating
                  the arguments that they expect and a brief summary of their 
                  purpose.

  --help-env      Print the command line option help message, listing
                  the environment variable equivalent for each flag (see
                  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FOR OPTIONS) and its current value.

  --help-settings   Print the command line option help message, listing
                 the current setting of each option as specified by
                 environment variables and other flags on the command line.

  --license       Print the compiler's license information.

  --version       Print the version number of the compiler.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES FOR OPTIONS

  Most compiler command-line options have an environment variable that can
  be used to specify a default value. Use the --help-env option to list the 
  environment variable equivalent for each option. Command-line options 
  will always override environment variable settings in the event of a 
  conflict.

  If the environment variable equivalent is set to empty, it is considered
  unset. This does not apply to options expecting a string or a path.

  For options that can be used with or without the leading --no (they are
  shown with "[no-]" in the help text), the environment variable equivalent,
  when set to a non-empty string, has the following effect. When the first
  character of the string is one of:

    Y y T t 1 - same as passing the option without --no,

    N n F f 0 - same as passing the option with --no,

    anything else - generates an error.

  For the other options that enable, disable or toggle some feature, any
  non-empty value of the environment variable equivalent has the same effect
  as passing that option once.


ENVIRONMENT

  See $CHPL_HOME/doc/README.chplenv for detailed information about 
  general environment variable settings, legal values, and default
  settings. Run $CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv to view your current
  settings (as explicitly set and inferred). Some of the most
  commonly-used environment variables are summarized here.

  CHPL_HOME           Specifies the location of the Chapel installation directory.

  CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM  Specifies the platform on which the Chapel compiler is

                      based on $CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM, $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM,
                      and $CHPL_HOST_COMPILER).

  CHPL_TARGET_ARCH    Specifies the architecture that the compiled executable
                      will be specialized to when --specialize is enabled
                      (defaults to a best guess based on $CHPL_COMM,
                      $CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER, and $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM).

                      $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM).

  CHPL_LAUNCHER       Specifies the launcher, if any, used to start job
                      execution (defaults to a best guess based on
                      $CHPL_COMM and $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM).

  CHPL_TIMERS         Specifies a timer implementation to be used by
                      the Time module (defaults to 'generic').

  CHPL_MEM            Specifies the memory allocator used for dynamic memory
                      management (defaults to a best guess based on $CHPL_COMM).

  CHPL_MAKE           Specifies the GNU compatible make utility
                      (defaults to a best guess based on
                      $CHPL_HOST_PLATFORM).

  CHPL_ATOMICS        Specifies the implementation to use for Chapel's atomic
                      variables (defaults to a best guess based on
                      $CHPL_TARGET_COMPILER, $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM, and
                      $CHPL_COMM).

  CHPL_GMP            Specifies the GMP library implementation to be
                      used by the GMP module (defaults to a best guess
                      based on $CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM and whether
                      you've built the included GMP library in the
                      third-party directory).

  CHPL_HWLOC          Specifies whether or not to use the hwloc library
                      (defaults to a best guess based on whether you've
                      built the included library in the third-party
                      hwloc directory).

  CHPL_REGEXP         Specifies the regular expression library to use
                      (defaults to 'none' or 're2' if you've installed
                      the re2 package in the third-party directory).

  CHPL_WIDE_POINTERS  Specifies the wide porter format format
                      (defaults to 'struct').

  CHPL_LLVM           When set to 'llvm', use the LLVM/Clang back-end
                      (defaults to 'none').

  CHPL_AUX_FILESYS    Specify runtime support for additional file
                      systems (defaults to 'none').

  CHPL_DEVELOPER      When set, build and compile in developer mode,
                      which generates line numbers in internal module
                      code and throws extra warning flags when
                      compiling the generated C code.

  CHPL_MODULE_PATH    Specifies a list of colon-separated directories to be 
                      added to the module search path. The module search path
                      is used to satisfy module 'use' statements. In the current
                      implementation, the compiler tries to locate unresolved
                      modules by searching for a filename whose name matches
                      that of the module. For example, if the user program
                      contains 'use foo' and the .chpl files listed by the
                      programmer on the compiler's command line do not define
                      a module named 'foo', the compiler will search for files 
                      named 'foo.chpl' in the module search path.

                      The complete path that will be searched can be displayed
                      using the --print-search-dirs flag and is composed of
                      (1) the directories containing the .chpl files that were
                      specified on the compiler command-line (in left-to-right 
                      order), (2) all directories specified by -M flags (in 
                      left-to-right order), (3) all directories specified by the
                      $CHPL_MODULE_PATH environment variable, (4) the
                      compiler's standard module search path.
