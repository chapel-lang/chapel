Chapel Acknowledgements
=======================

The Chapel project's source repository and releases are currently
hosted by [GitHub].  Our [community discussion forums] are hosted by
[Discourse].  We are grateful to both organizations for their ongoing
support.

Thanks to Google for funding several students to work on projects
within Chapel as part of the [Google Summer of Code] program.

The Chapel project was originally funded by the [Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency] under its Agreement No. HR0011-07-9-0001,
Contract No. HR0011-10-9-0008, and Contract No. NBCH3039003.  Any
opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in
this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily
reflect the views of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

This work was also supported by the [Center for Adaptive
Supercomputing Software for Multithreaded Architectures (CASS-MT)]
program at [Pacific Northwest National Laboratory], as well as the
[Laboratory for Telecommunications Sciences] at the [University of
Maryland].

Our research has made use of computing resources from the [National
Center for Computational Sciences] at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory],
which is supported by the [Office of Science] of the [U.S. Department
of Energy] under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725.

Thanks very much to [Argonne National Laboratory], [Barcelona
Supercomputer Center], [HPCx], [Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory], [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory], [Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory], [SARA], and the [University of Vienna]
for grants of machine time for testing the portability of our code
over the course of the project.

In its early years, this project was supported by a grant from
Washington Technology Center, and it was hosted for several years by
the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering] at the
[University of Washington] -- thanks to both groups for their support.

Thanks very much to [Intel] for donating compiler licenses during the
initial years of the project for the purpose of portability testing.
