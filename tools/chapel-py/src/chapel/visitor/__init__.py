def _try_call(dispatch_table, visitor, node, method_type):
    """
    Not every AST node in the dispatch table has an entry, unless the user
    literally defined a method for every node type. We want to approximate
    the behavior of inheritance when calling a method on the visitor:
    if there's no `enter` method for a function declaration, but there
    is an `enter` method for a named declaration (of which a function is a subclass),
    then we want to call the parent `enter`.

    To this end, search upwards from the current node's type until we hit
    'object', at which point we have traversed the entire inheritance hierarchy.
    For each class, starting from the node's class itself, check the
    table for a method called `method_type`. If one exists, call it and
    return its result, whatever it is, wrapped in a list.

    Example traversal:
      Function -> NamedDecl -> Decl -> AstNode -> object

    Results are wrapped in a list to distinguish between _try_call not
    finding a method to call at all (and thus returning `None`) from
    the method that was called itself returning `None` (in which case,
    the result will be `[None]`).

    other methods defined on the class, particularly those annotated with
    @enter and @exit.

    The traversal proceeds by means of 'enter' and 'exit' functions; see
    the documentation for those functions for more information. Enter
    and exit functions are both expected to take a single argument in addition
