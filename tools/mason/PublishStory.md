# Mason Publish

`mason publish` will be a command that when ran in a mason project will autmatically request for the package to be published in the mason-registry.

Already have a rough script that needs to be incorporated into the `mason` command line interface so users can run `mason publish` within a mason package to create a pull request for that package to the mason-registry. Will streamline the process of adding packages to the mason-registry, encouraging users to create mason packages when the barrier of entry has been lowered.
