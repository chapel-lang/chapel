This file documents the text data format of the VisualDebug.chpl output files.

First line of every file is:

  ChplVdebug: ver x.y nodes m nid n tid t seq s t1 t2 t3
     x.y is the version number.   The current version in 1.1.
     m is the total locale/node count. 
     n is the current node id
     t is the task id for this call to ChplVdebug.
     s is a sequence number for this run which is the time
        at the start of the call  (chpl_now_time()) (sec.usec format)
        ALL files from a single run must have the same s number.
     t1, t2 and t3 are times for reference, in order, (sec.usec format)
       timeofday, user time from rusage, system time from rusage

  In the following record definitions the following will stand
  for a number in the line:
     nid - local node id (locale)
     rid - remote node id
     tid - task id
     tv  - time of day value  (sec.usec format)
     tu  - user time          (sec.usec format)
     ts  - system time        (sec.usec format)
     tnum - tag number
     lnum - line number
     fileno - index in the file name table 

Lines in the file:

  Tablesize: size
    On locale 0 only, size of the file name table

  fname: ix name
    On locale 0 only, name of file in the file table at ix

  End: tv tu ts nid tid
    End collection of data, should be last line of file

  VdbMark: tv nid tid
    Mark a task as a VisualDebug task

  Tag: tv tu ts nid tid tnum name
    Tag in the data

  Pause:  tv tu ts nid tid tnum
    Pause the collection of data, tag number is previous tag

  task: tv nid tid parent_tid [OL] lnum fileno
    [OL] - on of O or L, O for an "on task", L for a "local task"
    Task creation, On tasks don't have valid lnum and fileno.

  nb_put: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length lnum fileno
  nb_get: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length lnum fileno
  put: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length lnum fileno
  get: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length lnum fileno
  st_put:  tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length lnum fileno
  st_get:  tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length lnum fileno
    communication.  Puts: data flow nid->rid, gets: data flow rid -> nid
    nb is non-blocking, st is strided.

  fork: tv nid rid subLoc funcId argPtr argSize tid
  fork_nb: tv nid rid subLoc funcId argPtr argSize tid
  f_fork:  tv nid rid subLoc funcId argPtr argSize tid
     fork a task on a remote locale.   nb is non-blocking, f_fork does
     not start a remote task.  Data is sent from nid to rid.
