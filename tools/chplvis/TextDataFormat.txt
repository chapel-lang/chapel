This file documents the text data format of the VisualDebug.chpl output files.

First line of every file is:

  ChplVdebug: ver x.y nodes m nid n tid t seq s t1 t2 t3
     x.y is the version number.   The current version in 1.2.
     m is the total locale/node count. 
     n is the current node id
     t is the task id for this call to ChplVdebug.
     s is a sequence number for this run which is the time
        at the start of the call  (chpl_now_time()) (sec.usec format)
        ALL files from a single run must have the same s number.
     t1, t2 and t3 are times for reference, in order, (sec.usec format)
       timeofday, user time from rusage, system time from rusage

  In the following record definitions the following will stand
  for a number in the line:
     nid    - local node id (locale)
     rid    - remote node id
     tid    - task id
     tv     - time of day value  (sec.usec format)
     tu     - user time          (sec.usec format)
     ts     - system time        (sec.usec format)
     tnum   - tag number
     commiD - unique ID per generated get/put, for mapping to generated code
     lnum   - line number
     fileno - index in the file name table
     fid    - function id number

Lines in the file:

  Tablesize: size
    On locale 0 only, size of the file name table

  fname: fileno name
    On locale 0 only, name of file in the file table at fileno

  FIDNsize: size
    On locale 0 only, size of the function name table.

  FIDname: fid lnum fileno name
    On locale 0 only, fid is function id, lnum and fileno
    are location of function creation point?

  CHPL_HOME: string
  DIR: string
    names of the directories needed to use the file names
    without having chplvis needing to be run in the
    source code diretory and with the same CHPL_HOME environment
    variable.

  tname: tnum tag_name
    On locale 0 only, name of a new tag

  End: tv tu ts nid tid
    End collection of data, should be last line of file

  VdbMark: tv nid tid
    Mark a task as a VisualDebug task

  Tag: tv tu ts nid tid tnum
    Tag in the data

  Pause:  tv tu ts nid tid tnum
    Pause the collection of data, tag number is previous tag

  task: tv nid tid parent_tid [OL] lnum fileno fid
    [OL] - on of O or L, O for an "on task", L for a "local task"
    Task creation, On tasks don't have valid lnum and fileno.
    fid is the locale independent function identifier

  Btask: tv nid tid
    Task has begun execution

  Etask: tv nid tid
    Task has ended execution

  nb_put: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length commID lnum fileno
  nb_get: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length commID lnum fileno
  put   : tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length commID lnum fileno
  get   : tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length commID lnum fileno
  st_put: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length commID lnum fileno
  st_get: tv nid rid tid addr raddr elemsize typeIndex length commID lnum fileno
    communication.  Puts: data flow nid->rid, gets: data flow rid -> nid
    nb is non-blocking, st is strided.

  fork: tv nid rid subLoc fid argPtr argSize tid
  fork_nb: tv nid rid subLoc fid argPtr argSize tid
  f_fork:  tv nid rid subLoc fid argPtr argSize tid
     fork a task on a remote locale.   nb is non-blocking, f_fork does
     not start a remote task.  Data is sent from nid to rid.
