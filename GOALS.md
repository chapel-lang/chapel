Chapel Public Release Goals
===========================

The goals of this release are as follows:

* to give the general public an opportunity to see the state and
  evolution of the Chapel implementation first-hand

* to get feedback on the Chapel language and its ongoing
  implementation (please direct to chapel_info@cray.com or the
  community mailing lists hosted at SourceForge)

* to demonstrate Chapel's base language features

* to demonstrate Chapel's task parallel features in a multi-threaded,
  multi-locale setting.

* to demonstrate Chapel's data parallel features via a combination of

  (i) a multi-threaded, single-locale implementation of ranges and
      irregular domains and arrays;

  (ii) a multi-threaded, multi-locale implementation of regular
       domains and arrays using some standard distributions.
