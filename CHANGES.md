Semantic Changes / Changes to Chapel Language
---------------------------------------------
- improved tasking semantics w.r.t. references to variables from outer scopes
  (e.g., in 'var x=0; begin { ...x... }', 'x' is a const copy within the task)
  (see 'Task Intents' section in the language specification)
- added 'ref' clauses to obtain the previous reference tasking semantics
  (e.g., 'var x: int; begin ref(x) { ...x... }' causes '...x...' to refer to x)
  (see 'Task Intents' section in the language specification)
- made blank intents for atomic variables get interpreted as 'ref'
  (see the 'Argument Intents' section in the language specification)
- added support for ranges, domains/arrays with small-int index types
  (e.g., 'range(int(8))' is now a supported type)
- added operator support for pairs of small int/uint types
  (e.g., 'int(8) + int(8)' now generates an int(8) rather than int(32))
- added operator support for homogeneous tuple/scalar pairs
  (e.g., (1,2,3) + 1 => (2,3,4))
- extended the member() method on domains to support varargs as well as tuples
  (e.g., 'var D = {1..n, 1..n};' supports 'D.member(i,j)' and 'D.member((i,j))')
- the compiler now only creates '==' operators for matching record types
- made 'bool' types prefer dispatching to 'int' args over smaller-int options
  (e.g., foo(true) will prefer to dispatch to foo(x:int) over foo(x:int(8)))

- improved single- and multi-locale data parallelism
  - all data parallel operations on arithmetic arrays are now parallelized
  - improved control over task quantity and granularity for data parallelism
  - improved completeness and stability of Block and Cyclic distributions
- bug fixes

Environment Changes
-------------------
- added CHPL_TASKS to select the tasking layer to use (was CHPL_THREADS)
  (see doc/README.chplenv and doc/README.tasks for details)
- CHPL_THREADS now describes lower-level threading and is typically inferred
  (see doc/README.tasks)
- changed the name of the default tasking layer from 'default' to 'fifo'
  (see doc/README.chplenv and doc/README.tasks)
- added CHPL_TIMERS to select between timer implementations
  (see doc/README.chplenv)
- changed the CHPL_*_PLATFORM string for 32-bit linux from 'linux' to 'linux32'
  (see doc/README.chplenv)

Syntactic/Naming Changes
------------------------
- several changes related to the naming and syntax of distributions:
  - renamed "distributions" to "domain maps" (or 'dmap's in Chapel syntax)
  - redefined the term "distributions" to refer to multi-locale domain maps
  - defined the term "layouts" to refer to single-locale domain maps
  - replaced placeholder 'distributionType'/'distributionValue' with 'dmap'
    (e.g., 'const D = distributionValue(...)' => 'const D = new dmap(...)'
  - changed the 'distributed' keyword to 'dmapped'
  - added a syntactic sugar to drop 'new dmap(new' for anonymous domain maps
    (e.g., '...dmapped new dmap(new Block(...))...' => '...dmapped Block(...)')
  (see 'Domain Maps' chapter of language specification for more information)
- renamed maxThreads to maxThreadsPerLocale (see README.tasks)
- renamed the 'ind2loc' method on domain maps to 'idxToLocale'
- renamed the Cyclic constructor 'low' argument to 'startIdx'
  (see 'Standard Distributions' chapter of the specification)
- replaced the use of underscore (_) to ignore things to leaving the space blank
  (e.g., '(_, x) = getTuple()' => '( , x) = getTuple()')
- made underscore (_) a legal identifier
- changed name of the Random module's SeedGenerator from clockMS to currentTime
  (see 'Standard Modules' chapter of the specification)
- added support for empty (no-op) statements within a class declaration
- added ability to elide the # of arguments specification/query from varargs fns
  (e.g., can now do 'def f(x...)' in addition to 'def f(x...?n)'/'def f(x...n)')

Semantic Changes/Changes to Chapel Language
-------------------------------------------
- added config consts to control the number of tasks used for data parallelism
  (see README.executing and 'Data Parallelism' chapter of specification)
- redefined enumerated domains to be a special case of associative domains
  (see 'Domains' chapter of specification)
- made iteration over enumerated domains/arrays use the enum's declaration order
  (see 'Domains' chapter of the specification)
- removed the ability to assign array aliases to normal array variables
  (e.g., 'var A => B;' is legal but 'var A: [1..n] real;  A => B;' is not)
- added initial support for passing array aliases to default class constructors
  (e.g., 'class C {var X: [1..n] int;} var A: [1..n] int; var c = new C(X=>A);')
- removed the sugar for declaring array types with forall expressions:
  (e.g., 'var A:[i in 1..n] real =...' => 'var A:[1..n] real = [i in 1..n] ...')
- defined reindexing to ignore the domain map of the indexing domain
- specified that minloc/maxloc reductions return the lowest matching index
  (e.g., 'minloc (A, 1..3)' for A = '5 0 0' would return (0, 2))
- type aliases may now only be used after they are defined
  (e.g., 'var x: t; type t = int;' is now illegal)
- changed resolution to favor functions with where clauses over those without
  (e.g., for 'foo(3)', 'foo(x)' is not as good a match as 'foo(x) where x:int')
  (see 'Function Resolution' section of the specification)
- added the ability to index into 1-dimensional arithmetic arrays using 1-tuples
  (e.g., 'var i: 1*int;  ...  A(i)' where A is a 1D arithmetic array)
- added the ability to query the component types of formal tuple arguments
  (e.g., 'def f(t: (real, ?t)) { ... }')
- redefined order-of-evaluation of tuple assignments to avoid array temps
  (see 'Tuples' chapter of specification)
- added support for indexing into tuples using any integral type, not just 'int'
  (e.g., given a tuple variable t, 'var i = 1:uint; ...t(i)...' is now legal)
- added support for 1-tuple detupled variable declarations for completeness
  (e.g., in 'var (x): 1*int;', x is of type 'int')
- redefined assignments to evaluate the left-hand side before the right
  (e.g., in 'x = y;', x is evaluated first and then y)

Newly Implemented Features
--------------------------
- whole-array assignment now results in parallel execution for arithmetic arrays
  (e.g., 'A = B; and 'A = B + alpha * C' now result in parallel execution)
  (see 'Data Parallelism' chapter for details)
- added support for assigning to a variable of dmap type if it has no domains
  (e.g., 'var myMap: dmap(Block(2)); myMap = new dmap(new Block([1..10]));')
- can now apply domain maps to domain values rather than simply domain types
  (e.g., 'const Dom1 = [1..10] dmapped ...')
- added support for sparse domain assignment (executed serially with a warning)
- added support for removing indices from a sparse domain (not thread-safe)
- added support for declaring formal tuple arguments of explicit tuple types
  (e.g., 'def f((x, y): (int, real)) { ... }')
- improved support for zippering domains/arrays with distinct domain maps

Standard Domain Maps
--------------------
- the Block and Cyclic distributed domain maps are now feature-complete
- added reindexing and rank change operations to the Block distribution
- reordered Block's constructor args so that rank and idxType can be inferred
  (e.g., 'new Block(rank=1, idxType=int(64), [1..n])' => 'new Block([1..n])')
- similarly reordered Cyclic's constructor args and renamed 'low' to 'startIdx'
- made int(32) the default idxType for standard distributions like Block
- moved all standard domain maps into modules/layouts/ and .../distributions/
- factored common routines for arithmetic domains into ChapelArray.chpl
  (e.g., nothing about exterior() is specific to a domain map's implementation)
- refactored helper functions for distributions into a new file: DSIUtil.chpl

Standard Modules
----------------
- refactored the code in the Random module and improved the implementation
- changed the Random module's SeedGenerator to an enumerated type

High-Level Themes
-----------------
- single-locale, multiple threads
- support for additional serial features
- improved single-threaded performance, memory utilization
- improved multi-threaded correctness, features
- target audience: HPLS evaluation team, HPCS mission partners, 
  select HPC users and centers

Changes to Chapel Language
--------------------------
- eliminated Chapel's sequence type
  - in the future, a standard List library will provide similar functionality
  - removed # and #= operators, since they were designed for sequences
  - removed support for sequence literals; use tuple syntax instead
    e.g., var A: [1..3] real = (0.1, 2.3, 4.5);
  - removed support for casting sequences to tuples and tuples to sequences
  - iterators in an expression context now result in a 1D, 1-based array
    e.g., "iterator foo() {...}  var A = foo();" creates a 1D array over [1..]
- added "range" type to language to replace old "arithmetic sequence" concept
  e.g., "lo..hi" or "lo..hi by str" are ranges
  - open interval syntax supported for ranges
    e.g., "[lo..hi)" is equivalent to lo..hi-1
  - +, -, *, / operators supported for range/scalar combinations
- added coforall loop construct for expressing explicit task parallelism
  e.g., "coforall 1..4 do ..." will create four explicit tasks
- removed "iterator" keyword -- iterators are now functions that contain yields
- added support for defining a default ("these") iterator for classes/records
- added support for creating array aliases
  e.g., "var Amid => A[2..n-1, 2..n-1];" creates an alias, Amid, to the slice
- support for standard math, bitwise, and comparison operators for tuples
  e.g., "(i,j) + (1,-1)" yields "(i+1, j-1)"
- added a swap operator: <=>
  e.g., "a <=> b" is semantically equivalent to "const t = b; b = a; a = t;"
- better support for writing output
  - enabled support for writing to strings using a write() method
    e.g., var s: string;  s.write("x is: ", x);
  - added a Writer class that enables user classes to be written to
  - added writeThis() method to specify how a type should be output to a Writer
- added minloc and maxloc reductions that return min/max value and index
  e.g., var (minVal, minInd) = minloc reduce (A, A.domain);
- changed arithmetic domain range access from D(<dim#>) to D.dim(<dim#>)
  e.g., var rows = D.dim(1);
- arithmetic domains and arrays support low and high methods that return bounds
  e.g., var loInd = A.low;
- support for range, domain, and array slicing via bounded or unbounded ranges
  e.g., "A[2.., ..n]" is equivalent to "A[2..A.dim(1).high, A.dim(2).low..n]"
- support for promoting casts across array elements
  e.g., var x: [1..4] real, y: [1..4] int;  y = x:int;
- added support for param functions that support compile-time evaluation
  e.g., "def square(param x) param { return x**2; }  param n2 = square(14);"
- support for default values for param members of classes
  e.g., class C { param bitWidth = 32; ... }
- support for top-level 0-argument functions without parentheses
  e.g., def f { writeln("In function f"); }
  - allow "main" function to be declared with or without parentheses
    e.g., def main { writeln("Program will start here"); ... }
- allow "<index> in" to be elided in for/forall loops/expressions
  e.g., "for 1..n { ... }", "var A = [1..n] 0.0;"
- support for multiple modules to be listed within a single "use" statement
- added support for reading a value of a specified type from a file
  e.g., "var myint = infile.read(int);"
