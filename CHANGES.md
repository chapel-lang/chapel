Semantic Changes / Changes to Chapel Language
---------------------------------------------
* added errors for missing conversions between types  
  (e.g. if `=` is provided then `init=` and `:` must be as well)  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.24/language/spec/conversions.html#implicit-conversions-for-initialization-and-assignment)

  (e.g., in `foo(1,2); proc foo(xs...) {}`, `xs(1)` is `2` where it was `1`)
* dimensional queries on multidimensional domains and arrays are now 0-based  
  (e.g., in `var A: [1..5, 0..2] int;`, `A.dim(1)` is now `0..2`, not `1..5`)
* changed the `string` and `bytes` types to be 0-based by default  
  (e.g., `"Chapel"[1]` now returns `"h"` where it used to return `"C"`)
* changed `find()` and `rfind()` on `string`/`bytes` to return -1 on failure  
  (e.g., see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.22/builtins/String.html#String.string.find)

  (e.g., `[1.2, 3.4]` now has type `[0..1] real` rather than `[1..2] real`)
* changed inferred-type captures of iterator expressions to use 0-based arrays  
  (e.g., in `var A = myIter();` A's domain is now `[0..]` rather than `[1..]`)

  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/builtins/Atomics.html#atomics)

Semantic Changes / Changes to Chapel Language
---------------------------------------------
* top-level modules must now be `use`d in order to be referenced  
  (see the `Using Modules` and `The Use Statement` sections of the Chapel spec)
* class types must now opt into being able to store `nil` using `?`  
  (e.g., `var myC: C = ...` cannot store `nil` but `var myC: C? = ...` can;  
   see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#nilability-changes)
* for a class `C`, `new C(...)` is now equivalent to `new owned C(...)`  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#new-c-is-owned)
* for a class `C`, un-decorated `C` now means non-nil and generic management  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#undecorated-classes-have-generic-management)
* passing owned/shared objects to untyped formals no longer changes their types  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#new-default-intent-for-owned-and-shared)
* arguments declared with owned/shared types now default to `const ref` intent  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#new-default-intent-for-owned-and-shared)
* string indexing, iteration, and lengths now use codepoint units by default  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/builtins/String.html#String.string.length)
* `string.find` now returns `byteIndex` values
* `void` is no longer allowed as the type of a variable (use `nothing` instead)  
  (see 'The Void Type' section in the 'Types' chapter of the spec)
* made `#0` preserve the given indices of a range or domain  
  (e.g., `5..#0` now returns `5..4` rather than `1..0`)
* disabled support for assigning from ranges to multidimensional arrays  
  (see 'Array Assignment' in the `Arrays` chapter of the language spec)
* made slice expressions be governed by their slicing domain  
  (e.g., in `ref B = A[D];` the domain of `B` is `D` rather than a copy of it)
* made `proc foo(x: bool(?))` generic across all bool sizes including `bool`
* `require` statements are now processed relative to the source file directory  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/technotes/extern.html#expressing-dependencies)

  (see 'Explicit Class Conversions' in the spec  
   and https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#readme-evolution-nilability-and-casts)
* casts from a C pointer type to a class type now require a nilable class  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/language/evolution.html#readme-evolution-nilability-and-casts)
* `isSubtype()` and comparison operators on types no longer consider coercions  
  (see https://chapel-lang.org/docs/1.20/builtins/UtilMisc_forDocs.html#UtilMisc_forDocs.isSubtype)

Semantic Changes / Changes to Chapel Language
---------------------------------------------
- improved tasking semantics w.r.t. references to variables from outer scopes
  (e.g., in 'var x=0; begin { ...x... }', 'x' is a const copy within the task)
  (see 'Task Intents' section in the language specification)
- added 'ref' clauses to obtain the previous reference tasking semantics
  (e.g., 'var x: int; begin ref(x) { ...x... }' causes '...x...' to refer to x)
  (see 'Task Intents' section in the language specification)
- made blank intents for atomic variables get interpreted as 'ref'
  (see the 'Argument Intents' section in the language specification)
- added support for ranges, domains/arrays with small-int index types
  (e.g., 'range(int(8))' is now a supported type)
- added operator support for pairs of small int/uint types
  (e.g., 'int(8) + int(8)' now generates an int(8) rather than int(32))
- added operator support for homogeneous tuple/scalar pairs
  (e.g., (1,2,3) + 1 => (2,3,4))
- extended the member() method on domains to support varargs as well as tuples
  (e.g., 'var D = {1..n, 1..n};' supports 'D.member(i,j)' and 'D.member((i,j))')
- the compiler now only creates '==' operators for matching record types
- made 'bool' types prefer dispatching to 'int' args over smaller-int options
  (e.g., foo(true) will prefer to dispatch to foo(x:int) over foo(x:int(8)))

---------------------------------------------
- several improvements to ranges (see 'Ranges' chapter in the language spec):
  - added a concept of alignment to indicate an alignment modulo |stride|
  - added an 'align' operator and query to ranges to specify/query alignment
    (e.g., '1..10 by 3 align 2' => '2, 5, 8' since 2 == 5 == 8, mod 3)
  - defined == on ranges in terms of the integer sequences they generate
  - defined ident(r1, r2) to say whether r1 and r2 are semantically identical

- added support to referencing modules without first 'use'-ing them
  (e.g., module M1 { var x...} module M2 { ...M1.x... } is now legal)
- added a callStackSize query to the locale type
  (e.g., 'here.callStackSize' returns the call stack size on the current locale)

  - renamed "distributions" to "domain maps" (or 'dmap's in Chapel syntax)
  - redefined the term "distributions" to refer to multi-locale domain maps
  - defined the term "layouts" to refer to single-locale domain maps
  - replaced placeholder 'distributionType'/'distributionValue' with 'dmap'
    (e.g., 'const D = distributionValue(...)' => 'const D = new dmap(...)'
  - changed the 'distributed' keyword to 'dmapped'
  - added a syntactic sugar to drop 'new dmap(new' for anonymous domain maps
    (e.g., '...dmapped new dmap(new Block(...))...' => '...dmapped Block(...)')
  (see 'Domain Maps' chapter of language specification for more information)
- renamed maxThreads to maxThreadsPerLocale (see README.tasks)
- renamed the 'ind2loc' method on domain maps to 'idxToLocale'
- renamed the Cyclic constructor 'low' argument to 'startIdx'
  (see 'Standard Distributions' chapter of the specification)

  (e.g., can now do 'def f(x...)' in addition to 'def f(x...?n)'/'def f(x...n)')

Semantic Changes/Changes to Chapel Language
-------------------------------------------
- added config consts to control the number of tasks used for data parallelism
  (see README.executing and 'Data Parallelism' chapter of specification)
- redefined enumerated domains to be a special case of associative domains
  (see 'Domains' chapter of specification)
- made iteration over enumerated domains/arrays use the enum's declaration order
  (see 'Domains' chapter of the specification)

  (e.g., 'var A => B;' is legal but 'var A: [1..n] real;  A => B;' is not)
- added initial support for passing array aliases to default class constructors
  (e.g., 'class C {var X: [1..n] int;} var A: [1..n] int; var c = new C(X=>A);')
- removed the sugar for declaring array types with forall expressions:
  (e.g., 'var A:[i in 1..n] real =...' => 'var A:[1..n] real = [i in 1..n] ...')
- defined reindexing to ignore the domain map of the indexing domain
- specified that minloc/maxloc reductions return the lowest matching index
  (e.g., 'minloc (A, 1..3)' for A = '5 0 0' would return (0, 2))
- type aliases may now only be used after they are defined
  (e.g., 'var x: t; type t = int;' is now illegal)
- changed resolution to favor functions with where clauses over those without
  (e.g., for 'foo(3)', 'foo(x)' is not as good a match as 'foo(x) where x:int')
  (see 'Function Resolution' section of the specification)
- added the ability to index into 1-dimensional arithmetic arrays using 1-tuples
  (e.g., 'var i: 1*int;  ...  A(i)' where A is a 1D arithmetic array)
- added the ability to query the component types of formal tuple arguments
  (e.g., 'def f(t: (real, ?t)) { ... }')
- redefined order-of-evaluation of tuple assignments to avoid array temps
  (see 'Tuples' chapter of specification)
- added support for indexing into tuples using any integral type, not just 'int'
  (e.g., given a tuple variable t, 'var i = 1:uint; ...t(i)...' is now legal)
- added support for 1-tuple detupled variable declarations for completeness
  (e.g., in 'var (x): 1*int;', x is of type 'int')
- redefined assignments to evaluate the left-hand side before the right
  (e.g., in 'x = y;', x is evaluated first and then y)

Newly Implemented Features
--------------------------

  (e.g., 'A = B; and 'A = B + alpha * C' now result in parallel execution)
  (see 'Data Parallelism' chapter for details)
- added support for assigning to a variable of dmap type if it has no domains
  (e.g., 'var myMap: dmap(Block(2)); myMap = new dmap(new Block([1..10]));')

  (e.g., 'const Dom1 = [1..10] dmapped ...')
- added support for sparse domain assignment (executed serially with a warning)

- added support for declaring formal tuple arguments of explicit tuple types
  (e.g., 'def f((x, y): (int, real)) { ... }')

Standard Domain Maps
--------------------
- the Block and Cyclic distributed domain maps are now feature-complete
- added reindexing and rank change operations to the Block distribution

  e.g., var rows = D.dim(1);
- arithmetic domains and arrays support low and high methods that return bounds
  e.g., var loInd = A.low;
- support for range, domain, and array slicing via bounded or unbounded ranges
  e.g., "A[2.., ..n]" is equivalent to "A[2..A.dim(1).high, A.dim(2).low..n]"
