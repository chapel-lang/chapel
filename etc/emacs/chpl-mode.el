;;; Commentary:

;; This is a mode for the Chapel programming language under
;; development by Cray Inc.  The mode itself was originally developed
;; by Steven T Balensiefer at UW as part of his course project for
;; CSE590o, based on the derived-mode-ex.el code supported with the
;; standard cc-mode.
;;
;; Note: The interface used in this file requires CC Mode 5.30 or
;; later.

;;; Code:

(require 'cc-mode)

;; These are only required at compile time to get the sources for the
;; language constants.  (The cc-fonts require and the font-lock
;; related constants could additionally be put inside an
;; (eval-after-load "font-lock" ...) but then some trickery is
;; necessary to get them compiled.)
(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cc-langs)
  (require 'cc-fonts))

(eval-and-compile
  ;; Make our mode known to the language constant system.  Use Java
  ;; mode as the fallback for the constants we don't change here.
  ;; This needs to be done also at compile time since the language
  ;; constants are evaluated then.
  (c-add-language 'chpl-mode 'c-mode))
