*README*                Chapel Mode for Vim


Chapel support for Vim has been designed for use with Vim versions 5.08 or
newer.


File Descriptions:
==================

 *ftdetect/chpl.vim* -- Allows vim to auto-detect the syntax highlighting
                        scheme for chapel files.
 *ftplugin/chpl.vim* -- Nice settings for Chapel editing
 *syntax/chpl.vim*   -- Syntax highlighting scheme for chapel
 *indent/chpl.vim*   -- Indenting scheme for chapel
 *sample-vimrc*      -- Sample .vimrc configuration file
 

Installation Instructions:
==========================

  - Create a directory in the root of your home directory called ".vim"

    $ mkdir $HOME/.vim

  - Copy the contents of this directory to your ".vim" directory

    $ cp -r * $HOME/.vim

  - Modify your .vimrc configuration file to enable automatic filetype
    detection, syntax highlighting, and indenting (this step is optional but
    recommended).

    $ vim $HOME/.vimrc

    OR: Use the sample .vimrc file provided (be careful you don't overwrite
    any existing .vimrc file!):

    $ cp -i sample-vimrc .vimrc


Enabling Chapel Support in Vim:
===============================

If you have chosen to use the *sample-vimrc* file you can safely ignore this
section.  Vim commands are denoted ": command".  You can give these commands
manually whenever you start a vim session (with the ":") or they can also be
given automatically every time vim is started by putting them in your .vimrc
file (without the ":").

  - Enable automatic filetype detection:

    : filetype on
  
  - Enable syntax highlighting scheme:
  
    : syntax on

  - Enable indenting scheme:

    : filetype indent on
