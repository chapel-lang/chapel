* = Note that due to a conversion mistake when moving our source
    repository from SVN/SourceForge to Git/GitHub, some past
    contributors' names were mapped to an incorrect name in the Git
    repository.

    For all intents and purposes, any commits that are
    attributed to...             should actually be attributed to...
    ----------------             -----------------------------------
    ...Tito Figueroa             ...Samuel Figueroa
    ...MaryBeth Seekamp          ...Mary Beth Hribar
    ...Charles Shannon Hendrix   ...Shannon Hoffswell

    These mistakes have been annotated in the repository itself via
    git-notes indicating the "Actual Commit Author."
