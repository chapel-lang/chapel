Performance: declaring an array over a remote const domain causes communication

The communication mostly comes from the on-statement used to update the
BaseDom's _arrs list.

This pattern exists in ISx, and likely in many other benchmarks. Since this
domain is global, we should not need to keep track of the _arrs list to know
when it is safe to destroy. Because it is const, we should not need the _arrs
list to update arrays when the domain is resized.

I think it should be possible to have the compiler insert a param that can be
used to avoid the on-statement overhead in this case. Then we should be able
to RVF the domain.
