semantic: domain equality (range equality, really)

This test was written to ask the similar questions as
test/ranges/bradc/rangeEquality.chpl for domains.

As noted in the range version of the .future, my proposed answer for
the third comparison differs here from ranges because of the fact that
domains are intended to define index sets, so arguably we should be
using set equality rather than ordered equality.

I don't feel 100% confident of this final point.  In particular, I
could imagine an argument that says "rectangular domains are ordered
therefore we could/should take order into account in computing
equality" and I'm open to this argument.  This question is very
closely tied to the one asked in domainOrder.chpl in this same
directory.

More extensive tests are in test/domains/sungeun/rect|assoc|sparse.
