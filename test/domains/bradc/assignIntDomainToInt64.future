feature request: assign (param) int(32) domain to int(64) domain

It seems like Chapel would be more orthogonal if one could assign an
int(64) param domain literal to an int(32) domain without casting,
much as one can assign an int(64) param to an int(32) variable.  I
suspect that this is simply an overly constrained implementation of
the domain classes than anything deep.
