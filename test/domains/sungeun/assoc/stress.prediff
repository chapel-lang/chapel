# This test is nondeterministic in the number of threads it creates.  If,
# in the final forall loop, an iteration reads the sync var then has a delay
# before writing it back, every other iteration could be forced to run in its
# own thread.  In this case it will warn that max threads per locale is
# unbounded, but unable to create more than NNNN threads.  Remove that
# warning since the limit is not always hit.
