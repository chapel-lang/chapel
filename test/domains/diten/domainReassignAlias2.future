semantic: what should happen to array aliases when domain is reassigned?

This is similar to domainReassignAlias.chpl, except here the alias is created
by passing an array slice to a function.

Currently, X remains aliased to the old, deallocated array, and is not valid
to access. The .good is my guess as to the correct behavior.
