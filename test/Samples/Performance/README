This directory contains a sample performance test which is used to
illustrate the example given in bestPractices/TestSystem.txt.  Note
that the test itself is bogus and is designed simply to illustrate the
mechanisms required to create a simple Chapel vs. C performance
comparison.

If something changes here, it probably needs to change in the .txt file too.


foo.chpl       : the (bogus) performance test written in Chapel
foo.good       : the expected output for a correctness test
foo.execopts   : the execution options to be used for a correctness test; this
                 turns off the output that will (usually) vary from run-to-run
foo.perfkeys   : the performance keys to look for in the test output

foo-c.test.c   : a "C version" to compare against in our performance graph
foo-c.good     : the expected output for the C correctness test
foo-c.perfkeys : the performance keys to look for in the C test output

foo.graph      : the graph file for comparing these two
