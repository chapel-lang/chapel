bug: promoted array assignment with downcasting of complex(128)

The following program results in a compile-time error during function
resolution as a result of the promoted assignment of A to a `complex(128)`
literal. The error message (with `CHPL_DEVELOPER=true`) is:

```
$CHPL_HOME/modules/internal/ChapelIteratorSupport.chpl:95: error: cannot iterate over values of type complex(128)
$CHPL_HOME/modules/internal/ChapelIteratorSupport.chpl:95: note: unresolved call had id 1089401
```

Ideally, I'd expect this program to succeed, with the literal assignment
`A = i +0i` being downcasted from `complex(128)` to `complex(64)`. A potential
short-term solution might be to give a more meaningful error message, such as a
type error.
