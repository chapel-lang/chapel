bug: Unable to nest associative domains. 

While it is possible to nest other recursive types within each other, this is
not the case for associative arrays.  When one attempt to do so the following
runtime error is encountered: 

error: halt reached - zippered associative array does not match the iterated
domain

This is the same error encountered when specifying an associative array literal
with a type expression that includes a populated associative domain.  Perhaps
these are related?
