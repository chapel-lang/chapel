feature request: array literals should be able to be of compatible derived types

This test shows that an array literal whose elements are of distinct
but compatible derived types are not currently supported.  I believe
they should be (this case was submitted by Uwe Zimmer).  Specifically,
I think we should treat such cases similarly to how we treat type
unification in determining a function's return type in the presence of
multiple return statements.

That said, oops, it looks like we don't actually (automatically) infer
the type when a function returns two derived types either.  See
test/functions/bradc/inferReturnForDerivedTypes.chpl.

(If we had, I was going to suggest that a quick-and-dirty
implementation approach for implementing array literals might be to
convert them into functions that return values based on an input
integer 'i' and replace the array literal expressions with calls
to the function.  :)

This test also shows a workaround which is to downcast the derived
types to the base type.
