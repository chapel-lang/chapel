bug: declared array of array formal argument types do not work

Neither "[1..3] [] real" nor "[] [] real" for declaring array-of-array
formal argument types work today.  Making the argument type inferred
does work so can serve as a workaround, but isn't ideal for users
who prefer to declare their types.
