feature request: 1D array writing -> newline

When working with arrays of arrays recently, it was
frustrating that our default array printing for them
didn't generate linefeeds between the inner arrays.
I think that this would probably require generating
a linefeed after a 1D array is printed (at least
that would be the easiest solution?), which we
decided against originally, but not with this case in
mind I believe.  I'd like to revisit this choice
under the argument that most of our default writes 
are pretty clean (and that it's easier for the user 
to generate a 1-line display of an array of an arrays
than it is to generate the multi-line display; and
that we hope to have some nicer knobs [someday,
eventually], to control this stuff anyway).
