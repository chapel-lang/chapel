feature request: math operators on ranges

It seems reasonable that this code should work similarly to
paulslice.chpl, but it doesn't, I believe due to the fact
that operations on arithmetic sequences result in the
sequences being expanded rather than creating a new arithmetic
sequence?  Seems like it would be nice to preserve arithmetic
sequence-ness if possible.

Also, I'm noting in paulslice.chpl that multiplying an
arithmetic sequence by a scalar results in a striding of
the sequence.  Offhand, I'm not sure whether this is the
correct behavior or whether just the bounds of the sequence
should be scaled.  Good fodder for discussion.
