unimplemented feature: for/forall-expression with arrays as elements
#11039

Once this feature is implemented, return to the following original .future:
bug: an unexpected interpretation of the expression: [1,2,3,4][2]

Kyle discovered that [1,2,3,4] is being parsed as a forall loop.

Brad says:
* The [1,2,3,4] should be interpreted as an array literal and indexing by [2]
should yield '2', since our array literals use 1-based indexing by default.
* I don't think that [1,2,3,4] should syntactically be a legal forall expr.
I can't recall why these productions use 'expr_ls' rather than something
that suggests a singleton expression.

Vass says that even in the forall-loop interpretation the result of
four-times-[2] should be an array of arrays, not a single array.
