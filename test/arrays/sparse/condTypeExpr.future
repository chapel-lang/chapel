bug: conditional type expression leads to valgrind errors

Something about this conditional type expression is leading to
valgrind errors... :( Note that if 'useCS' is false, it does not.
Michael thinks that this is due to (a) the use of a conditional
expression and (b) the use of a dmapped clause.  I think he's right
about (b), as swapping the then and else clauses seems to reverse the
behavior.  However, I tried changing the conditional expression into a
function as he suggested and still got valgrind errors in that case as
well.

Once this test is working, its .skipif should/could be removed
