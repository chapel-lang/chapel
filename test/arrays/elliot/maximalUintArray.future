bug: Maximal uint arrays are not initialized

Arrays like `[0:uint(8)..255:uint(8)] int` are not initialized because of
overflow. Currently range.size is passed in as the size of the array to be
initialized, but range.size overflows for maximal uint arrays so it uses a
size of 0.

I think the correct behavior is to either properly initialize maximal arrays or
to report an error about not supporting maximal arrays, similar to what we do
for iterating over ranges that will overflow.

When this bug is resolved, the test should be updated with a description and be
made more like the nearMaxmialUintArray test.
