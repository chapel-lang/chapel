array literal indexing not working as expected

In this program, I expected that I'd written an array literal and
indexed into it, as a short-hand form of:

```chapel
var A = [1, 2, 3];
writeln(A[1]);
```

However, it seems from the result that the expression `[1, 2, 3][1]`
is being parsed as though it was an index-less variation of the forall
loop: `[i in [1, 2, 3]] [1]`.  However, this seems wrong to me in that
I wouldn't think that `[1, 2, 3]` would/should/could be considered a
forall expression (whereas `[[1, 2, 3]]` could be).
