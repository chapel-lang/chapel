bug: array slices should be permitted to initialize array fields

This is a test that used to work when we implemented array views using
closed-form/dsi* routines rather than the array view domain maps.  The
problem is that the compiler-generated initializer is overly specific,
requiring the actual to be a DefaultRectangular array.  Arguably, it
should permit things that could be passed to a DefaultRectangular
formal (or, more accurately, a formal that doesn't specify a domain
map).

This is related to issue #5289.
