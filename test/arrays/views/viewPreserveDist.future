bug: domains of rank-change and reindex views no longer preserve locality

With the new array views work, the domains of rank-change and reindex
array views no longer preserve locality as they traditionally have /
ought to.  This future is a placeholder to restore this capability in
the future, probably by introducing domain/distribution view classes
that similarly translate down to the original domain/distribution
classes.
