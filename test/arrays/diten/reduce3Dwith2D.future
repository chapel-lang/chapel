bug: zipper iteration of mismatched ranks

This test needs a compiler error message.

was:


The current expected behavior of this test is to use the default iteration
orders of both arrays to produce a 1D sum, which is reduced.

This test currently causes leader/follower iterators to get used, and gets
a compile time tuple index out of bounds error. If A and B are swapped:
"+ reduce (B + A);", the serial iterators are chosen instead and the reduction
gets the right result.  See reduce3Dwith2D.chpl for that case.

This should eventually be an error because the shapes don't match and the
result of promotion should not automatically be flattened to 1D.
