# This test requires the use of --fast-followers to generate correct output
# and since the test is examining if our default behavior makes the entire test
# use fast followers, it doesn't make sense to force the flag to be thrown in
# all cases.  So turn it off for the cases where we would normally expect this
# optimization not to be in use.
