feature request: auto-reindex when passing arrays to well-defined formals

Up until the PR which this commit is part of, when passing an array to
a formal arguments whose domain is defined, we would reindex the array
when passing it in.  Current thinking is that the user should somehow
request this reindexing in the code.  They could do it explicitly, as
in the rewrites that I've done for the historical tests here; however,
it would also be nice to simply have a way to say "yes, please reindex
me as necessary" to get the historical behavior from the formal's type
without having to type its domain explicitly.  I don't particularly like
the proposed syntax that I'm using here, so consider it a placeholder
designed to break this test until we come up with something good.
