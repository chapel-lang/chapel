bug: returned array expressions not checked against return type's domain

At present, when a function declares an array return type and we
return a promoted expression, we return an array of the return type's
size even if the expression being returned doesn't match it as shown
in this test.  This seems wrong and likely an off-shoot of our current
bugs related to zippered iteration in which

* largeArray = smallArray; // results in an OOB error
* smallArray = largeArray; // results in a silent truncation

A question about tests like this is whether the domain named in the
formal signature must literally be the same domain as the returned
expression, or merely have the same indices; and would we want to do
different things here for anonymous vs. named domains.
