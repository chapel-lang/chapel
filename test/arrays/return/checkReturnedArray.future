bug: declared return type mismatch with returned expression not caught

At present, when a function declares an array return type, we return
an array of that type even if the expression being returned doesn't
match it.  This seems unfortunate.

A question about tests like this is whether the domain named in the
formal signature must literally be the same domain as the returned
expression, or merely have the same indices; and would we want to do
different things here for anonymous vs. named domains.
