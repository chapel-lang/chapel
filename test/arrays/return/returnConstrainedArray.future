feature request: constrain returned array type

This test requests some means of constraining the type of the array
being returned to help those reading the function signature know what
to expect.  I've made up a syntax that "sort of" makes sense here by
trying to show the type of the domain that will describe the returned
array expression.

Note that although in this test the domain value can be described very
precisely, for other patterns (say, a function that reads an array of
integers from a file without knowing how large it is) we can't
anticipate how large the array will be, only its type.
