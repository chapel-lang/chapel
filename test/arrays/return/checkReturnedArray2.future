bug: returned array expressions not checked against return type's domain

At present, when a function declares an array return type, we don't
check that an array of the specified type (in this case, of the right
size) is returned.  This seems incorrect and likely to cause user
confusion.

A question about tests like this is whether the domain named in the
formal signature must literally be the same domain as the returned
expression, or merely have the same indices; and would we want to do
different things here for anonymous vs. named domains.
