Specifying the --main-module flag when all but one of the
user modules are obviously inert seems annoying to me.  I
think the reason we decided not to support this was because
variable initializers are executable, but it seems like a
module consisting only of types, enums, and functions at
the top level should not be a candidate for the main module by
default.

If this is fixed, a bunch of compopts can be simplified
for associative tests that use the helper module -- let Brad
know so he can clean it up.
