Specifying the --main-module flag when all but one of the
user modules are obviously inert seems annoying to me.  I
think the reason we decided not to support this was because
variable initializers are executable, but it seems like a
module consisting only of records, classes, and unions at
the top level should not be a candidate for the main module by
default (unless we change the language definition to support
static class constructors?).
