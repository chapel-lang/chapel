# Fuzz the calculated "average temperature" values in the test output file.

# The ZMQ weather example/test program uses a pub/sub communication model.
# A ZMQ pub/sub connection is inherently unreliable (like UDP, unlike TCP).
# If one or more messages get dropped, the values of "average temperature"
# will come out different than usual, and Chapel's automated test harness
# will raise an error.

# This prediff fuzzes the calculated data just enough so the test will pass,
# even if a few ZMQ messages get dropped as described above.

sort $outfile | sed -e 's, [0-9.+-]* F$, xx.x F,' > $outfile.tmp

# Note: the corresponding weather.good file has been fuzzed to agree with
# the test output, after this prediff.
# FYI, here is the original test output from a normal weather.chpl test run
# with no dropped messages (February, 2017)
#
# Average temperature for zipcode '10001' was 41 F
# Average temperature for zipcode '60290' was 100.8 F
# Average temperature for zipcode '90001' was 11.6 F
# Average temperature for zipcode '20001' was 16.2 F
