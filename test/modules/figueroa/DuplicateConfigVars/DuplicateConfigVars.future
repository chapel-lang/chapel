semantic: warning for module use shadowing variable in outer scope

really?  Does Java or C# give a warning?

feature request: compiler should warn about shadowing variables via use statement
If two modules define the same symbol, and both are in scope at the point
at which this symbol is used, the compiler should complain instead of
silently using the one introduced at the innermost scope (through a use
statement).  In this test case, both seed and arraySize are defined
in both source files.
