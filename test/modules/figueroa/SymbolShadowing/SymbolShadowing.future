error message: use before def in module use statement

error message: message unclear when using imported symbol before use statement
In this test case, the same symbol, arraySize, is declared in two different
modules.  There is a writeln statement that uses arraySize before the use
statement.  The programmer may be unaware that arraySize is actually imported
via the use statement, and could be left scratching his/her head until bald
because the current error message ("actual type is unknown or generic") is not
helpful in understanding what's wrong.
