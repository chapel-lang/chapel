bug: Cannot use a record type from another module without using the module.

(2015-06-19)
At this point in time, the _defaultOf() called on a type is a function.  This
means that it is not visible when just accessing the record through a module
accessor instead of a module use, so trying to initialize the record type fails
to find it.

There are several potential strategies to fix this, as suggested by Brad: one
could move such _defaultOf() functions to some parent scope; one could have the
_defaultOf() function for a module-qualified record name also be
module-qualified; or one could make _defaultOf() functions into static methods
on types.
