bug: module name ties with other module's symbol rather than beating it

This program demonstrates a bug that I just introduced in which N's
M.x ought to beat module M's x, but doesn't.  I think that I broke
this when I introduced lastResortModuleMatch to
UseStmt::skipSymbolSearch() since it resolves to the module name
sooner than anticipated.  It'd be worth understanding again why I
thought this was necessary rather than having the module be more of a
last resort if none of the use's symbol lists do the job.
