The .good file for this test must be specified on a machine-by-machine
basis, as the test reports the amount of physical memory available on
a machine.

The .prediff script can compute the .good file on the fly for machines
that support /proc/meminfo and for Darwin (Mac OS X).  For other
machines, the .prediff script will need to be specialized or the .good
file hardcoded (or the test skipped).
