bug: on certain machines, valgrind will recognize an invalid read with fac_ui

When this future was created, chap07 was set up in such a way that building the
Chapel runtime and GMP led to an invalid read in fac_ui, as detected by
valgrind.  This did not occur on a separate machine, lydia-lnx.  A C version of
the basic case linked against our GMP build results in the same problem, as
demonstrated by this future.

When this future has been resolved, please remove the valgrind skipif for
test/modules/standard/gmp/ferguson/gmp_dist_array.chpl and this file.
