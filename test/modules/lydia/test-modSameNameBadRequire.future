feature request: support 'use' creating a submodule warning on 'require' statements for .chpl files

Right now, `require Foo.chpl;` doesn't create an AST node to latch onto later
in compilation when we actually know the full contents of the block statement,
so we can't output the warning we do for 'use' statements and other 'require'
statements for non-.chpl files.
