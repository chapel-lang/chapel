bug: function resolution on package modules

Lydia's comment on the issue:
we suspect the problem lies with the creation of the visibleFunctionMap during
functionResolution but are confused as to why the behavior that works for the
standard modules does not apply seamlessly to the package modules here

More details - quoting Lydia:
what is broken is explicit naming of functions defined within a package module.
Line 7 works just fine, and line 8 is broken in all cases where a function in a
standard module is explicitly named, even those without use statements.

Tested modules so far
Math:   works (no pun)
Norm:   works
Curl:   works
Sort:   no works
Search: no works

_filtered_ grepmod dumps of tested modules - as per Lydia's suggestion

$ grepmod "use Math"
modules/internal/ChapelRange.chpl:  use Math; // for abs().
modules/internal/ChapelStandard.chpl:  use Math;
modules/packages/LinearAlgebraJama.chpl:use Math;

$ grepmod "use Norm"

$ grepmod "use Curl"  

$ grepmod "use Sort"
modules/internal/DefaultAssociative.chpl:  use Sort; /* only sort */;
modules/layouts/LayoutCSR.chpl:use Sort;
modules/standard/FileSystem.chpl:      use Sort /* only sort */;

$ grepmod "use Search"
modules/internal/DefaultSparse.chpl:  use Search;
modules/layouts/LayoutCSR.chpl:    use Search;

Those that are not used by internal modules seems to be working fine.
