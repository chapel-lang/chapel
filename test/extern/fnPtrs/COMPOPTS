# CCE is pretty strict about pointers and so complains about our

# expecting a true function pointer.  This flag squashes the warnings
# in question for the tests in this directory.  The more robust
# solution would be to give the programmer the ability to specify the
# argument and return types of their c_fn_ptr()s (though we may want
# to always preserve the current ability to be non-specific for the
# sake of putting code together quickly/generically.
