feature request: Helpful message for Chapel fn actual -> C fn formal mismatch

Lydia suggested that it would be nice to have a message (like the one
proposed here, or an equivalent) that would give the user the hint
that using c_ptrTo() might help fix their issue.  I agree but it was
more than I could take on at present.
