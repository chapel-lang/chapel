feature request: extern "struct foo" types

My current implementation of external structs assumes that a typedef
has been used to name the struct.  This means that if a Chapel routine
accepts an external record named foo, the argument is code generated
as "foo" rather than "struct foo".  Ultimately, I believe we will want
to support both options and that an external record will come out as
"struct foo" by default.  To get the foo version, I would expect that
one would need to do "_extern record _foo { ... }" followed by
"_extern type foo = _foo;" but I haven't gotten this working yet and
want to make some other restructuring changes to how we handle type
aliases first.
