error message: 'use' of literal string prints temp name rather than string

In deprecating the support for 'use "foo.c"' in favor of 'require "foo.c"'
I noticed that this error message isn't as clear as it should be.  I'm
not sure whether it's always been this way or whether it requires some
updates as a result of the recent string changes.
