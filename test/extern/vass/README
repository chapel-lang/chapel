These tests used to lead to invalid generated code w.r.t. references
to c_sublocid_any. Now, thanks to munging, they work correctly.
As of this writing, we still do not munge the generated C code for
internal modules. So we may have c_sublocid_any-related issues there.

Why it is c_sublocid_any that is in the spotlight?

Because it used to be a #define constant in a runtime header.
So even if the generated C code declares a local variable of that
name, expecting everything to work correctly, it could not be
compiled because of the #define.
As of this writing, c_sublocid_any is no longer a #define constant.
