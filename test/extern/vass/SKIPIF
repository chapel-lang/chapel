# We used to SKIPIF these tests also when if --no-munge-user-idents.
# At the moment, they happen to pass except for one. So the
# munge-related skipif condition is just on that test for now.
# If other tests stop working under --no-munge-user-idents
# in the future, it may be OK to skipif them again.
