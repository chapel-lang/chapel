COMPOPTS <= --baseline

#At the time of this .suppressif's creation, this test fails under --baseline
#due to a bug in codegen. The field-accessor for 'foo' is not inlined, and so
#its body includes a GET_MEMBER call that is meant to fetch a reference to the
#'foo' field. Currently an LLVM-specific branch recognizes this exact case and
#replaces the GEN_PTR with a GEN_VAL, leading to a failure later when attempting
#to generate an ADDR_OF. Using the C backend results in an "attempt to
#dereference nil" failure at execution time.
