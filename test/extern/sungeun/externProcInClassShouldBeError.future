error message: Invalid extern declaration in class results in confusing C compile-time error.

This fails because we add the 'this' argument to the call.  It would
be nice to maybe warn that an extern function was declared inside of a
class definition.

This test essentially parallel/taskPar/sungeun/private.chpl except
that the extern declaration is accidentally placed at the class-level
in localePrivateData.  I made a few attempts to make this example
simpler, but the simpler examples don't seem to work.
