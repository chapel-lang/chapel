bug: extern record with c_long field fails to compile with --no-inline

When the reference getter for the c_long field is not inlined it attempts to
assign a 'long *' to a '_ref_int64_t', and the C compiler issues an error.

When the getter is inlined, it assigns the field directly without going
through a pointer and it compiles fine.
