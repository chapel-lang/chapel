bug: extern function with array argument that returns non-trivial void fails

Issue #13046

An extern function with an array argument gets called through a wrapper that
turns the array argument into a simple pointer for the underlying function.
The wrapper returns the result of the call to the extern function.  If the
extern function is 'void' the wrapper shouldn't return it.

If the extern function has an explicit 'void' type through a type alias or
a type function, we aren't currently able to detect this when the wrapper is
built, so the wrapper returns a call to a function that has no return value.

If dead code elmination is enabled, the bad code gets removed, but it ideally
shouldn't be created in the first place.
