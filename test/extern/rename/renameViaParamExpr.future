unimplemented feature: param renaming of types and vars

While we support renaming of functions via general param string
expressions, extern variables, class, and records can currently only
be renamed using string literals, and extern types can't be renamed at
all.  This future requests treating all of these the same and
permitting any of them to be renamed using a param expression.  THe
proposed approach is to add an 'Expr* cnameExpr;' field to the Symbol
class and to resolve the name for all these declaration types in a
unified manner.
