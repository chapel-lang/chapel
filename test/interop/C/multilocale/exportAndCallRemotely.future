bug: exported functions should be able to be called remotely

This test shows that currently we seem to assume that exported
functions can/will only be called with local arguments.  While this is
true for a call from an external language like C, it isn't true if the
exported function is called from within Chapel.  Exporting a function
should not preclude it from being called from within Chapel, nor from
being called remotely from within Chapel.  In cases like this, I
believe the correct thing to do is to clone the function such that
there's a locals-only version that is exported (using the
user-provided name) and a wide-is-OK version that uses a different
name and is used for calls from within Chapel programs for --no-local
compilations.
