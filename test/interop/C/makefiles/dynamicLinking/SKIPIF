# If your shared library has a text relocation, it means that the library
# isn't position independent code (PIC).
#
# An older dynamic linker might outright refuse to load a shared library with
# text relocations present.
#
# On many modern systems, the dynamic linker is able to load a shared library
# that isn't PIC, but it is forced to load a separate copy of the library's
# text segment into the address space of each process that needs to use
# the library.
#
# Thus, without PIC one of the main benefits of using a shared library (which
# is that each process can share a _single_ copy of the library's text
# segment) is lost.
