If #16412 is answered in the negative, then the compiler correctly reports
an error when compiling this test.

However, the user is likely to benefit from knowing which function got
promoted. This .future requests that the appropriate filename:linenumber
be printed as part of the error message.

Also, the "currently not implemented" line of the error message will need
to be changed to "not allowed".
