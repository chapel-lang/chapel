bug: instantiating a CG type multiple times

When invoking this CG function:

    proc minFn(x:?T, y:T):T where implements LessThan(T) {...}

on (real, int), T gets instantiated to `int` whereas it should
be instantiated to `real`. This is likely because in the implementation,
ResolutionCandidate::isApplicableGeneric --> computeSubstitutions,
it does not distinguish between `?T` and `T` where T is a CG type,
so the substitution map ends up with the later instantiation,
which is `int`, instead of the one with `?`, which is `real`.
