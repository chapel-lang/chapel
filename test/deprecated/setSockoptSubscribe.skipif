 The ZMQ package requires the zmq library.

 Installation of the ZMQ library is detected with the find_library function,
 which looks for the appropriate dynamic library (e.g. libzmq.so).
 Note that if the dynamic library is found, this test assumes that the
 header and static library are available.
