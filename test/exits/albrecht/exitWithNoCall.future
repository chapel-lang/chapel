bug: Compiling 'exit' without parens or args results in an internal error

The desirable compiler error would let the user know they probably meant
to call the exit function like 'exit()'.

Alternatively, we could consider interpreting the standalone 'exit' as 'exit()'


The current compiler output:

exitWithNoCall.chpl:1: In function 'main':
exitWithNoCall.chpl:1: internal error: Cannot call insertBefore on Expr not in a list [expr.cpp:384]
