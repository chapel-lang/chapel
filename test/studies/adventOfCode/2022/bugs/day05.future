bug / error message: This should work, whouldn't it?

Using readLine() in this way gives an error in an internal module.
Using it like `stdin.readLine()` seems to work fine.  This makes
me think that some wiring got broken somewhere.  Otherwise, we
should make it into a nicer user-facing error message
