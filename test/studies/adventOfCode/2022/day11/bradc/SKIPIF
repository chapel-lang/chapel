# 32-bit platforms don't use native qthread 'sync' variables and are
# painfully slow for this benchmark's full problem size, so skip them.
# Arm also doesn't currently support native qthread 'sync' variables,
# but should soon, so Elliot suggested not worrying about that for now
# (and we're not seeing failures in our current testing configurations,
# likely just due to not running these tests on arm).
