Advent of Code 2021
===================

These are my (Brad's) personal entries to Advent of Code 2021.  At
present, they are snapshots of what I coded up in my spare time
between Dec 8 and Jan 3, and often aren't indicative of best practices
in software engineering or in using Chapel.  As time permits, I may go
back and clean them up over time to improve them in both respects.

Though none of the problems required parallel solutions, since Chapel
is a parallel language, when possible/easy I did try to utilize
parallelism.  As the problems became more challenging and the holidays
approached, I got less aggressive about this.  In general, I also
tried to use the Chapel features that I thought were the coolest or
most appropriate for the problems rather than sticking to a C-like
subset of Chapel.

Generally, speaking, the files are as follows for a given day:

* dayX.chpl      : my program for the first (grey) star
* dayXa.chpl     : my program for the second (gold) star
* dayX.test      : the input set used by the AoC site as a sample
* dayX.in        : my (personal?) input for that day
* dayX*.execopts : execution-line command-line options for our test system
* dayX*.good     : the expected output for our test system

On days where multiple test cases were given, I've often also added
additional input and .good files.
