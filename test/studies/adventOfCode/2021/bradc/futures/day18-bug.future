error message: confusing error message about default initializing

This error message _may_ be correct, but seemed confusing to me
because it looked to me like the variable in question ('left')
should not be default-initialized, and also because it referred
to a compiler temporary rather than the user variable name.

For the .good file here, I'm putting in the output I was hoping for,
though perhaps simply a better error message would be better if I'm
wrong and this should be default initialized.
