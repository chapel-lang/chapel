Initialize 2-D SW matrix, set all locations to empty

Set upper and left boundary rows to full

Loop over ant-diagonals, starting upper left-hand (NE) corner

   Loop over length of anti-diagonal

      Read {N, E, NE} neighbors, only if full

      Calculate Smith-Waterman maximum

      Store S-W maximum, setting location to full

   End loop

End loop
