Hi Brad,

I've attached the sudoku solver for 590o.  Some thoughts:

1.  It appears that this works mostly only for easy Sudoku.... *grumble 
grumble*  The harder puzzles don't seem to work with my method...I hope 
that is okay. 

2.  The box indexing and box remainder stuff feels awkward and long and 
blah...any suggestions?  If not, no big deal.

3.  When I added parallelism, (i.e. instead of for (i, j) in TableSpace 
became coforall (i, j) in TableSpace) I end up with race conditions of 
some sort.  Running the solver 4 or 5 times on the input works...except 
for when it dies.  My understanding (which could be wrong) is that 
Chapel is supposed to automatically take care of these things 
intelligently, but I'm not sure. 

Anyway, enjoy!

Kate
