This copy of LULESH has been getting different/wrong answers with icc
ever since we turned on the --vectorize capability, for the loop on
line 1077.  Removing the 'param' keywords on the for loops fixes the
issue and is probably what we want for LULESH anyway, so we updated
the release version with this change, but are tucking this version
away to see whether it resolves with future versions of icc, or so
that we can explore the question further if need be.
