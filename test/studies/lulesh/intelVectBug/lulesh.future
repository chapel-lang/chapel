bug: icc vectorization issue

When the loops at line 1077 have 'param' attached to them (and are
therefore fully unrolled), and --vectorize is on, the correct result
is not computed.  It's currently unclear to us whether this is a bug
in Chapel's generated code (e.g., improper usage of ivdep for icc) or
whether it indicates a bug in icc, though we're currently
hypothesizing the latter.  Removing the params makes the issue go
away, and arguably we don't want the params anyway, so for the release
version of the code, we've removed these.  This is a snapshot of the
previous released version of the code so that we can investigate this
issue further or detect if it goes away with future versions of icc.
