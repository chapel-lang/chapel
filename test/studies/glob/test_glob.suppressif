# AMM-related bug; should be fixed when string-as-rec is merged
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# With --baseline, we free the domain(string) in the parallel glob
# iterator too aggressively; the AMM work on the string-as-rec branch
# seems to correct this, so let's suppress this case until that fix
# can be integrated.
COMPOPTS <= --baseline
