module block_outer_product_cholesky {

  // =========================================================================
  // The Cholesky factorization  A = L L^^T is defined by the following sets
  // of scalar equations derived by expanding the matrix-matrix product on
  // the right side of the matrix equation:
  //
  //               A(i,j) = + reduce ( L (i, ..) L (j, ..)
  //
  // As written, these equations do not recognize the symmetry of A and the 
  // triangular structure of L.  Recognizing those two facts allows us to turn
  // these equations into an algorithm for computing the decomposition.
  //
  // Main diagonal:  
  //    L(j,j) = sqrt ( A(j,j) - (+ reduce [k in ..j-1] L(j,k)**2 ) )
  // Below main diagonal:
  //    L(i,j) = ( A(i,j) - (+ reduce [k in ..j-1] L(i,k) * L(j,k) ) ) / L(j,j)
  //
  // These equations can be promoted to block equations by treating:
  //    scalar/ multiplication involving only non-diagonal blocks as ordinary 
  //       matrix-matrix multiplication;
  //    scalar/ multiplication involving diagonal blocks as ordinary triangular
  //       or symmetric matrix-matrix multiplication;
  //    taking the Cholesky factor of a block as its square root.
  //
  // Conventionally only one array argument, A, is used in factorization
  // routines, and only the lower triangle is used.  On output the entries of 
  // L overwrite the entries of A.  The partial sums of the reductions are 
  // accumulated during the course of the algorithm also in the space occupied
  // by the input matrix  A.  Conventionally, the entries in the upper
  // triangle of A are left untouched. 
  // =========================================================================
 

  // =========================================================================
  // The outer product Cholesky factorization computes one block column of L at
  // each step. During each step the remaining columns of A are modified by a 
  // low rank outer product modication -- the reduce operations are accumulated 
  // one block step at a time for each entry in the yet unfactored part of the
  // matrix.  The computed entries of L will not otherwise need to be 
  // referenced again in the factorization.
