  // =========================================================================
  // The Cholesky factorization  A = L L^^T is defined by the following sets
  // of scalar equations derived by expanding the matrix-matrix product on
  // the right side of the matrix equation:
  //
  //               A(i,j) = + reduce ( L (i, ..) L (j, ..)
  //
  // As written, these equations do not recognize the symmetry of A and the 
  // triangular structure of L.  Recognizing those two facts allows us to turn
  // these equations into an algorithm for computing the decomposition.
  //
  // Main diagonal:  
  //    L(j,j) = sqrt ( A(j,j) - (+ reduce [k in ..j-1] L(j,k)**2 ) )
  // Below main diagonal:
  //    L(i,j) = ( A(i,j) - (+ reduce [k in ..j-1] L(i,k) * L(j,k) ) ) / L(j,j)

  // Note that only entries in L to the left or in the main diagonal above
  // appear on the right hand side of either of these equations.  Thus, at the
  // outset, the leading diagonal element is computable, followed by any or all
  // other entries in the first column.  The order in which the entries overall
  // must be computed is specified only by the data dependencies expressed in
  // the two equations above.  There are many orderings of these operations that
  // satisfy the dependency constraints.  Three standard orderings of those 
  // operations are given in this file; these compute L one row or one column at
  // a time.  these do not begin to exhaust the possible orerings.  To show the
  // potential for much more general orderings , a data-flow version of the
  // algorithm will be implemented separately.

  // Conventionally only one array argument, A, is used in factorization
  // routines, and only the lower triangle is used.  On output the entries of 
  // L overwrite the entries of A.  The partial sums of the reductions are 
  // accumulated during the course of the algorithm also in the space occupied
  // by the input matrix  A.  Conventionally, the entries in the upper
  // triangle of A are left untouched. 
  // =========================================================================
 

  // =========================================================================
  // The inner product Cholesky factorization also computes one column of L at
  // each step, in a manner reflecting the reduction form of the defining
  // equations.  During each step the previous columns of L are read to
  // implement the separate reduction operations for each entry of the current
  // column.  For efficiency, the reduction operations are combined into a 
  // matrix-vector product form.
