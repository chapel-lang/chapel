# elegance

This is a suite of tests that demonstrate performance deltas between Chapel
code written in an 'elegant' form and a 'performant' form.

Each test includes a short description in the comment header. As we learn more
about the performance difference, we can improve the descriptions.

Ideally, the elegant implementations should approach the performant
performance numbers, as Chapel matures. Of course, beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, meaning this may already be true for some HPC developers out there.
