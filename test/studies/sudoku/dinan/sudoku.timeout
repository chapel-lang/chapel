# This is a long running test that has occasional timeouts for
# gasnet+qthreads. This test only uses 1 locale for gasnet testing
# so it's not obvious if this timeout can be removed when we test on
# real hardware. I would guess it can be, and that the slowdown is
# because qthreads is built with over-subscription which makes
# performance for an individual qthreads instance worse so that
# multiple ones can run on a machine simultaneously.
