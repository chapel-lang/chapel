semantic: what should happen when returning an iterator record?

Here is a smaller program showing the issue:

  proc run() {
    var D: domain(1) = {1..4};
    var A: [D] string;
    A = computeLyric(D);
  }

  proc computeLyric(D) {
    var NumArray = 99 - D;
    return " " + NumArray;  // returns an iterator record b/c promotion
                            // this iterator record refers to NumArray
                            // which will be destroyed on function exit
  }

  run();


" " + NumArray is an iterator expression, which is returned
from computeLyric. But, after it is returned, the captured array
NumArray has already gone out of scope and been destroyed.
