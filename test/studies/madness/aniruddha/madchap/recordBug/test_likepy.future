bug: Recursive iterator inlining not implemented completely.

After the body of a recursive iterator function is split off in
expandRecursiveIteratorInline(), it appears that createIteratorFn is never
called on it, or alternatively, convertYieldsAndReturns() is not called
directly.  One way or the other, PRIM_YIELD primitives in the original recursive
iterator are not replaced They show up in code generation, where they are
flagged as an error.

A newly added verification tests assumes that all PRIM_YIELD primitives have
been replaced after the lowerIterators pass completes, so this future fails
immediately in check_afterLowerIterators().
