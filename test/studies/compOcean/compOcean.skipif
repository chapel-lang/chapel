# The NetCDF package requires the netCDF library.
#
# Installation of the netCDF library is detected with the find_library function,
# which looks for the appropriate dynamic library (e.g. libnetcdf.so).
# Note that if the dynamic library is found, this test assumes that the
# header and static library are available.

# On systems with Cray modules, this finds the library inside a module even
# though the module is not loaded.  Avoid those "false positive" systems.
