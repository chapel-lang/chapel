/* General roadmap of this file:
 * Create a file handle and connect to HDFS
 * Get replication, block size and length of file
 * Get the hosts that the blocks of the file resides on
 * Get the blocks
 * Connect to HDFS
 * Open the file 
 * Create an array for each beer name (we have an assoc beername <==> number of
 reviews)
 * For each block
 * Get the host that the block resides on TODO: check this
 * if the locale we're on owns this block (i.e we own it)
 * Fetch the contents of the block
 * Read in characters from the file
 * Get the start of the review we want to parse
 * if we cant, say so and exit
 * Get the length (in characters) of the review in question
 * Split what you read in, so now we have ss = review in question
 * Read review in to be a record 
 * Increment the number we have read by 1
 * Record observation(s) in accumlator(s)
 * Return back the number of reviews for each beer
 ============ Procedures ================
 * IndexOf(ss: string, s: string, start: int) 
 -- Given a string s, we return the index of the 
 first occurence of the substring ss after start.
 * deserializeRecord(s: string) 
 -- Parses a review into its internal representation as a record
 * findFieldValue(s: string, fieldStart: string, base: int) 
 -- Returns a tuple (field, value_of_field). i.e (beer, beerID)
 * findFieldValueReal(s: string, fieldStart: string, base: int) -- Need to talk with Brad about this one...
 * findFieldValueInt(s: string, fieldStart: string, base: int) -- Same here

 ==================== FIXME's  ====================================
 * Make BeerAdvocateRecord smaller (Don't want to do this right now, want to keep code
 more general)
 - Make deserializeRecord not parse every field of the review and put inside a
 record instead just skip past all the ones that we dont care about, and just
 return the beer_ID (talk to Brad to make sure this would be "kosher")
 - Removing deserializeRecord would allso have the efect of eliminating a fair
 amount of code (most likely)
