bug: can't use forall expressions within an initializer

I expect that this is the same bug as in issue #5935.  Even after this
bug is fixed, it may be that I'm using generic fields more
aggressively than I should be permitted to (or that our implementation
will permit for the time being), in which case this future may need to
be updated further.  But this is an intriguing version of the benchmark
to strive for.
