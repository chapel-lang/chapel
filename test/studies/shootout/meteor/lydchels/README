As it stands now, the meteor implementation is incomplete.  We (Rachel Sobel 
and Lydia Duncan) based the portions of this code that are implemented off of
the Java solution to meteor, found here: 

http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~jacques/cursos/2004.2/gr/recursos/j-javaopt.pdf

Going through that document piece by piece (ha, punny) we have implemented 
several classes required for the solution as outlined above: Cell, PieceCell,
portions of Piece and a new class (PieceList) created to encapsulate the cells
in a useful fashion.  The comments for these classes are extensive, and 
hopefully comprehensive.  BoardCell and Board classes are created as stubs
but entirely unimplemented.  The algorithm itself is unimplemented.

There are a number of tests in the directory "tests", none of which are in
start_test form.  If you want them to be, you will have to do it yourself,
unfortunately.  They do give extensive output relative to the actions of the
implemented classes after which they are named, which should be useful in 
the meanwhile.
