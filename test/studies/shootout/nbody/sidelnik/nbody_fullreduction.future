bug: reduction over the arrays in an array of class objects does not work

The current bad output is a nil deference.  I don't know if the
behavior described in the original text below still holds.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
We are seeing a strange bug in where performing a reduction
on an array element type, AND, traversing the outer array in a
for loop is causing a floating point error exception. If we take
out the traversing of the outer array, the output is correct.
