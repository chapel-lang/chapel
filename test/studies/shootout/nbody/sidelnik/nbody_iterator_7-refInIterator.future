bug: ref vars in iterators break for --baseline testing

It seems that when we have refvars in iterators, we get a segfault
when compiling with --baseline.  I suspect that this is due to the
fact that the iterators are represented by objects and we don't
support ref vars in objects at present.  I believe that this only
shows up in --baseline for this test because the objects are optimized
away for non-baseline testing.  I suspect that with effort, one could
write an iterator that showed this behavior with non-baseline testing
if the compiler couldn't get rid of the class (e.g., by using multiple
yields and/or loops, perhaps?)
