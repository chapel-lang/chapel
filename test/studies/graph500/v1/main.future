bug: 'data' field in DefaultRectangularArr freed when still in use

The data field (class _ddata) is being freed in dsiReallocate() via a
direct call to dsiDestroyData(), but it may still be in use due to
calls that copy the field (i.e., reindexing, slicing, or rank change).

There needs to be some sort of tracking of references to the data
field.  It seems possible to roll this into the current reference
counting on arrays.

This tests periodically seg faults with --no-local and GASNet.  It
consistently fails valgrind testing with --no-local.
