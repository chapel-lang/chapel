<H2>HPL Algorithm</H2>

<STRONG>
This  page provides  a high-level description of the algorithm used in
this package. As indicated below,  HPL  contains in fact many possible
variants for various operations.  Defaults could have been chosen,  or
even  variants  could  be selected  during  the execution.  Due to the
performance requirements,  it was  decided  to leave the user with the
opportunity of choosing,  so that an "optimal" set of parameters could
easily be experimentally determined for a given machine configuration.
From a numerical accuracy point of view, <STRONG>all</STRONG> possible
combinations are rigorously equivalent  to each other  even though the
result may slightly differ (bit-wise).

<H3><A NAME="main">Main Algorithm</A></H3>

This  software  package  solves  a linear system  of order n:  A x = b by
first  computing  the  LU  factorization with row partial pivoting of the
n-by-n+1 coefficient matrix [A b] = [[L,U] y]. Since the lower triangular
factor L is applied to b as the factorization progresses, the solution  x
is obtained  by  solving  the upper triangular system U x = y.  The lower
triangular  matrix  L  is left unpivoted  and  the array of pivots is not
returned.<BR><BR>

The  data  is distributed onto a two-dimensional P-by-Q grid of processes
according  to  the  block-cyclic  scheme  to ensure  "good"  load balance
as well as  the scalability  of the algorithm.  The  n-by-n+1 coefficient
matrix is  first  logically partitioned into  nb-by-nb  blocks,  that are
cyclically "dealt" onto the  P-by-Q  process grid.  This is done  in both
dimensions of the matrix.</TD>

The  right-looking  variant  has been chosen for the main loop of the  LU
factorization.  This  means that at each iteration of the loop a panel of
nb columns is factorized,  and  the  trailing submatrix is updated.  Note
that this computation is  thus  logically partitioned with the same block
size nb that was used for the data distribution.</TD>

<TD ALIGN=LEFT>
At  a given iteration  of the main loop,  and  because of  the  cartesian 
property of the distribution scheme,  each panel factorization  occurs in
one column of processes.   This  particular part of the computation  lies
on the critical path of  the overall algorithm.  The user is  offered the
choice of three  (Crout, left- and right-looking)  matrix-multiply  based 
recursive variants. The software also allows the user  to choose  in  how
many  sub-panels  the current panel  should be divided  into  during  the
recursion.  Furthermore,  one  can also  select at run-time the recursion
stopping criterium in terms of the number  of  columns left to factorize.
When this  threshold is reached,  the sub-panel will  then be  factorized
using one of the three Crout, left- or right-looking matrix-vector  based 
variant.  Finally, for each panel column the pivot search, the associated
swap  and broadcast  operation  of  the pivot row  are combined  into one 
single communication step.  A   binary-exchange  (leave-on-all) reduction
performs these three operations at once.</TD>

<H3><A NAME="bcast">Panel Broadcast</A></H3>

Once  the panel factorization has been computed,  this  panel  of columns
is  broadcast  to the other process columns.   There  are  many  possible 
broadcast  algorithms  and  the  software currently offers  6 variants to 
choose from.  These variants are described below assuming  that process 0
is the source of the broadcast for convenience. "->" means "sends to".
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Increasing-ring</STRONG>:  0 -> 1;  1 -> 2; 2 -> 3 and so on.
This algorithm is the classic one;  it has  the caveat that process 1 has
to send a message.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="1ring.jpg">
</CENTER>

<LI><STRONG>Increasing-ring (modified)</STRONG>:  0 -> 1;  0 -> 2; 2 -> 3
and so on. Process 0 sends two messages and process 1  only  receives one
message. This algorithm is almost always better, if not the best.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="1rinM.jpg">
</CENTER>

<LI><STRONG>Increasing-2-ring</STRONG>:  The Q processes are divided into
two parts: 0 -> 1 and 0 -> Q/2;  Then processes 1  and Q/2 act as sources
of two rings: 1 -> 2, Q/2 -> Q/2+1;  2 -> 3, Q/2+1 -> to Q/2+2 and so on.
This  algorithm has the advantage  of reducing the time by which the last
process  will  receive  the  panel  at  the  cost  of process 0 sending 2
messages.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="2ring.jpg">
</CENTER>

<LI><STRONG>Increasing-2-ring (modified)</STRONG>:  As  one  may  expect,
first 0 -> 1,  then  the  Q-1  processes  left are divided into two equal
parts: 0 -> 2 and 0 -> Q/2;  Processes  2 and Q/2  act then as sources of
two rings:  2 -> 3,  Q/2 -> Q/2+1; 3 -> 4,  Q/2+1 -> to Q/2+2  and so on.
This algorithm is probably  the most serious competitor to the increasing
ring modified variant.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="2rinM.jpg">
</CENTER>

<LI><STRONG>Long  (bandwidth  reducing)</STRONG>:  as   opposed   to  the
previous  variants,  this  algorithm  and  its follower  synchronize  all 
processes involved in the operation. The message is chopped into  Q equal
pieces that are scattered  across the Q processes. 
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="spread.jpg">
</CENTER>
The pieces are then rolled in Q-1 steps.  The scatter phase uses a binary
tree and the rolling phase exclusively uses mutual message exchanges.  In
odd steps 0 <-> 1,  2 <-> 3, 4 <-> 5 and so on;  in even steps Q-1 <-> 0,
1 <-> 2, 3 <-> 4, 5 <-> 6 and so on.
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="roll.jpg">
</CENTER>
More messages are exchanged, however the total volume of communication is
independent of Q, making this algorithm  particularly suitable for  large
messages.  This algorithm  becomes  competitive  when the nodes are "very 
fast" and the network (comparatively) "very slow".<BR><BR>

<LI><STRONG>Long (bandwidth reducing modified)</STRONG>:  same  as above,
except that 0 -> 1 first,  and then the Long variant is used on processes
0,2,3,4 .. Q-1.<BR><BR>

The rings variants are distinguished by a probe mechanism  that activates
them.  In other words,  a process involved in the broadcast and different
from  the source asynchronously  probes for the message to receive.  When
the  message  is  available  the broadcast proceeds,  and  otherwise  the
function returns.  This allows to interleave the broadcast operation with
the update phase. This contributes to reduce the idle time spent by those
processes waiting for the factorized panel.  This  mechanism is necessary
to accomodate for various computation/communication performance ratio.<BR><BR>
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="look_ahead">Look-ahead</A></H3>

Once the panel has been broadcast or say during this broadcast operation,
the trailing submatrix is updated  using the last panel in the look-ahead
pipe: as mentioned before,  the panel factorization  lies on the critical
path,  which  means  that when the kth panel has been factorized and then 
broadcast, the next most urgent task to complete is the factorization and
broadcast of the k+1 th panel.  This technique  is  often  refered  to as
"look-ahead" or "send-ahead" in the literature.  This  package  allows to
select various "depth" of look-ahead.  By  convention,  a  depth  of zero
corresponds to no lookahead,  in which case  the  trailing  submatrix  is
updated by the panel currently broadcast.  Look-ahead consumes some extra
memory  to  essentially  keep  all the panels of columns currently in the
look-ahead pipe.  A look-ahead  of depth 1 (maybe 2) is likely to achieve
the best performance gain.<BR><BR> 
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="update">Update</A></H3>

The update of the trailing submatrix by the last panel in the  look-ahead
pipe is made of two phases. First, the pivots must be applied to form the
current row panel U. U should then be solved by the upper triangle of the
column panel. U finally needs to be broadcast to each process row so that
the  local  rank-nb  update  can take place.  We choose  to  combine  the
swapping and broadcast of  U  at the cost of  replicating the solve.  Two
algorithms are available for this communication operation.
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Binary-exchange</STRONG>:  this is a modified variant  of the
binary-exchange (leave on all) reduction operation.  Every process column
performs the same operation.  The algorithm essentially works as follows.
It pretends reducing the row panel U, but at the beginning the only valid
copy is owned by the current process row.  The  other process  rows  will
contribute rows of A they own that should be copied in U and replace them
with rows that were originally in the current process row.  The  complete
operation is performed in  log(P) steps.  For the sake of simplicity, let
assume that  P  is a power of two.  At step k,  process row p exchanges a 
message with process row p+2^k.  There are  essentially two cases. First,
one of those two process rows  has received  U  in  a previous step.  The
exchange occurs.  One process  swaps  its  local rows of  A into U.  Both
processes copy in  U remote rows of A. Second, none of those process rows
has received U,  the exchange occurs, and both processes simply add those
remote rows  to  the list  they have accumulated so far.  At each step, a 
message  of  the size of  U  is exchanged by at least one pair of process
rows.<BR><BR>

<LI><STRONG>Long</STRONG>:   this  is   a   bandwidth   reducing  variant
accomplishing the same task. The row panel is first spread (using a tree)
among the process rows with respect to the pivot array. This is a scatter
(V variant for MPI users).  Locally,  every process row  then swaps these
rows with the the rows of A it owns and that belong to U.  These  buffers
are then rolled  (P-1 steps) to finish the broadcast of U.  Every process
row permutes U and proceed  with the computational part of the update.  A
couple  of  notes:   process  rows  are  logarithmically   sorted  before
spreading,  so  that  processes  receiving the largest number of rows are
first in the tree.  This makes  the communication volume optimal for this
phase. Finally, before rolling and after the local swap, an equilibration
phase occurs during  which the local pieces of  U  are  uniformly  spread
across  the process rows.  A tree-based algorithm is used. This operation
is necessary to keep the rolling phase optimal  even  when the pivot rows
are  not  equally distributed  in  process rows.  This  algorithm  has  a 
complexity  in  terms  of communication volume that solely depends on the 
size of U.  In particular,  the number of process rows  only  impacts the
number of messages exchanged.  It  will  thus  outperforms  the  previous
variant for large problems on large machine configurations.<BR><BR>

</UL>

The user can select any of the two variants above.  In addition, a mix is
possible as well.  The  "binary-exchange"  algorithm will be used when  U
contains at most a certain number of columns. Choosing at least the block
size  nb as the threshold value is clearly recommended when look-ahead is
on.<BR><BR>
<HR NOSHADE>

<H3><A NAME="trsv">Backward Substitution</A></H3>

The factorization has just now ended, the back-substitution remains to be
done.  For this,  we  choose  a look-ahead  of  depth  one  variant.  The
right-hand-side  is  forwarded  in  process  rows  in  a  decreasing-ring 
fashion,  so that  we solve Q * nb entries at a time.  At each step, this
shrinking piece of the right-hand-side is updated. The process just above
the one owning the current diagonal block of the matrix  A  updates first 
its last nb piece of x,  forwards it to the previous process column, then
broadcast  it in the process column in a decreasing-ring fashion as well.
The solution is then updated and sent to the previous process column. The
solution of the linear system is left replicated in every process row.<BR><BR>
<HR NOSHADE>
 
<H3><A NAME="check">Checking the Solution</A></H3>

To verify the result obtained,  the input matrix  and right-hand side are
regenerated. Three residuals are computed and a solution is considered as
"numerically correct"  when  all  of these quantities  are  less  than  a 
threshold value of the order of 1.0. In the expressions below, eps is the
relative (distributed-memory) machine precision.
