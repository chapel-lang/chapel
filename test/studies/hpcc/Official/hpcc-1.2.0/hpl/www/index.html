<STRONG>HPL</STRONG> is  a software  package  that solves  a (random)
dense  linear  system  in  double  precision   (64  bits)  arithmetic
on  distributed-memory  computers.    It  can  thus  be  regarded  as
a portable as well as  freely available  implementation  of the  High
Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark.<BR><BR>

The <STRONG>algorithm</STRONG> used  by HPL  can be summarized by the
following keywords:  Two-dimensional  block-cyclic data  distribution
- Right-looking variant  of  the  LU  factorization  with row partial
pivoting  featuring  multiple  look-ahead depths  -  Recursive  panel
factorization  with  pivot  search  and  column  broadcast combined -
Various  virtual  panel  broadcast topologies  -  bandwidth  reducing
swap-broadcast  algorithm -  backward  substitution  with  look-ahead
of depth 1.<BR><BR>

The  HPL package  provides  a testing and timing program  to quantify
the  <STRONG>accuracy</STRONG> of  the obtained solution  as  well as
the time it took to compute it. The best <STRONG>performance</STRONG>
achievable by this software on your system depends on a large variety
of factors.  Nonetheless,  with some restrictive assumptions  on  the
interconnection  network,   the  algorithm  described  here  and  its
attached implementation  are <STRONG>scalable</STRONG>  in  the sense
that their parallel efficiency is maintained  constant  with  respect
to the per processor memory usage.<BR><BR>

The HPL software package <STRONG>requires</STRONG>  the  availibility
on your system of an implementation of the  Message Passing Interface
<STRONG>MPI</STRONG> (1.1 compliant).
An implementation of <STRONG>either</STRONG> the Basic Linear Algebra
Subprograms   <STRONG>BLAS  or</STRONG>   the   Vector  Signal  Image
Processing Library <STRONG>VSIPL</STRONG> is also needed.
Machine-specific as well as generic implementations of
<A HREF = "links.html#mpi_libs">MPI</A>, the
<A HREF = "links.html#blas_libs">BLAS</A> and
<A HREF = "links.html#vsip_libs">VSIPL</A> are available  for a large
variety of systems.<BR><BR>
