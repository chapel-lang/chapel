 High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark (HPL)
 HPL 1.0a - January 20, 2004
==============================================================

 HPL is a software package that solves a (random) dense linear
 system  in   double  precision  (64   bits)   arithmetic   on 
 distributed-memory  computers.   It can thus be regarded as a
 portable as well as  freely  available implementation  of the
 High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark.

 The  HPL  software  package requires the availibility on your
 system of an implementation of the  Message Passing Interface
 MPI  (1.1 compliant).  An  implementation of either the Basic
 Linear Algebra Subprograms  BLAS  or the  Vector Signal Image
 Processing Library VSIPL is also needed.  Machine-specific as
 well as generic implementations of MPI, the  BLAS  and  VSIPL
 are available for a large variety of systems.
