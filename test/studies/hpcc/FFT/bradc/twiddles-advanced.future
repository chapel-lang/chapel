semantic: query syntax for array bounds of formal argument

This is pushing it.  Seems at least like a semantic future.


feature request: formal array argument bounds query

This is a very advanced version of the twiddles function in
which we use an anonymous domain with query bounds to determine
an array's size rather than a separate query function.  Though
I  think there are questions about how far we'd want to push
this concept, I think for the simple 1D case it makes a lot
of sense.  Not sure where I'd draw the line currently...
