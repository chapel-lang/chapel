NOTE: All versions are compiled using basically the same problem size
module.

STREAM:

Fragmented (no BlockDist):

These versions are like release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/stream-ep.chpl, 
*except* that they use whole array assignment.

./STREAMS/bradc/stream-fragmented.chpl       | EXACTLY the same except the
./STREAMS/diten/stream-fragmented-local.chpl |  -local version has a local
                                             |  statement around the timed
                                             |  computation

Global:

These versions are like release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/stream.chpl.

./STREAMS/bradc/stream-block1d.chpl          | Most like release version
./STREAMS/bradc/stream-block1d-local.chpl    | Same but compiled with --local
./STREAMS/bradc/stream-block1d-promote.chpl  | Same but uses whole array
                                             |  assignment
./serial-v0.7/stream.chpl                    | Uses whole array assignment
                                             |  and no BlockDist


RA:

./RA/bradc/parallel/ra-dist.graph | No "on" or "local" optimization like the
                                  |  release version
./serial-v0.7/ra.graph            | Same and no BlockDist
