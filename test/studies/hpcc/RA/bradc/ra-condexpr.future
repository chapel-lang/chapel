bug: implicit parameter coercions in conditional expression

In this code, if param (or 0) is not explicitly typed as
uint(64), a typecheck error occurs on combining ints and
uints.  My understanding of the parameter coercion rules
suggests that the result of the conditional expression
should be cast to the appropriate type since both of the
result values are params.
