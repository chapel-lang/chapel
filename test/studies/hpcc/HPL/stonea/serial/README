This directory conatins various snapshots of the code I created while
implementing Chapel's version of the HPL benchmark.  These snapshots are:

    hplExample1:
        Serial, blocked, pivoted version of LU decomposition. It factors an n
        by n + 1 matrix).  This version uses the Panel2D structure (read the
        comments in the source for more info).  Includes a number of unit
        tests.

    hplExample2:
        No longer uses Panel2D structure.  Uses HPL style verification by
        evaluating equations with norms in them.

    hplExample3:
        Uses a matrix-multiply in a mannar intended for distributed
        parallelism. Specifically this matrix multiply comes from the luLike2
        example in /studies/matrixMult/stonea/distributed, but it has been
        modified to work with all sizes of matrix and block.

        Stripped of most unit tests from previous versions (just to reduce file
        size, get it down so it looks like the more manageble version we'll
        submit for HPCC.  I'm now convinced these tests pass anyway.)

    hplExample4:
        Modified version of hplExample3 that cleverly uses domain slicing to
        make for more succinct code.
