This test fails to work with the new "deallocate arrays at the end of
their lexical scope even if slices/aliases are still referring to
them" semantics; and looking at the code's heavy use of =>, ._value,
and custom localSlice() routines, it's not difficult to believe that
that's the case.  Talking with Vass, we decided that this code falls
into the "interesting historical artifact" category and that it wasn't
worth determining what would be necessary to make it work in the new
world anymore, so we're marking it as .notest instead.
