#
# The only place in the code that does non-trivial domain slicing is this:
#   if (Dom[Panels[ij]].size > 0)
#
# Here Dom is distttributed and Panels[ij] is local (default rectangular).
# Since all we need is the size of the slice, there is no need
# for the overhead of creating a distributed domain for the slice.
#
# Therefore we opt into the new domain slicing semantics
# so that the slice results in a local, not distributed, domain.
