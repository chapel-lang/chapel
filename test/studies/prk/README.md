# Intel's Parallel Research Kernels (PRK)

https://github.com/ParRes/Kernels

This is a set of simple programs that can be used to explore the features of a
parallel platform.


## Implementations:

Each kernel is implemented in a variety of parallel flavors, such as "serial",
"shared", and "dist"-ributed. There is also two versions for each flavor:
a "fast" version optimized for performance and a
"pretty" version optimized for elegance. Ideally, the performance delta
between these versions will approach zero over time.

The test inputs were taken from the inputs used in the PRK test scripts.
