This directory contains a copy of LLNL's implementation of CoMD in Chapel as of
commit a2162b1f from the GitHub repository:

https://github.com/LLNL/CoMD-Chapel

The following changes were made for compatibility with Chapel's testing
infrastructure and more recent Chapel compilers:

----- Significant source changes -----
- Chapel 1.15 deprecated the '=>'  operator in favor of 'ref'
- In 1.15 'noRefCount' config param was removed
- In 1.15 array internals changed such that calling doiBulkTransferStride
  manually (as was done in the original LLNL source) became too cumbersome.
  The statement was replaced with a normal array assignment.

----- Minor source changes for infrastructure -----
- Added means to print a simpler format for timings
- Renamed 'types' to 'MDTypes' to avoid conflict in Chapel standard module
  path(s).

----- Moved/new files -----
- Moved many .chpl files into new 'util/' directory to easily NOTEST them
- Added various files for start_test (.compopts, .good, etc.)
