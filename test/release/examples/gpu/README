Chapel Examples: GPU Examples
=============================

This directory contain examples of Chapel code that make use of GPUs.  To run
these examples, Chapel must be built with GPU support enabled, which can be
done by setting CHPL_LOCALE_MODEL=gpu and rebuilding Chapel.  For more
information about installing and using Chapel with gpu support see the
following technical note: https://chapel-lang.org/docs/technotes/gpu.html
