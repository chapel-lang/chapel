# This test creates a large array of atomics designed to use ~1/4 of available
# memory. However, that calculation is done based off the size of the raw type,
# not the atomic type. When CHPL_ATOMICS=intrinsics, the size of the atomic is
# the same as the raw type. Unfortunately when CHPL_ATOMICS=locks, atomics are
# implemented as a struct that contains the raw type and a sync var. Under
# qthreads each syncvar is currently ~40 bytes which which means we run out of
# memory since we're using ~6x ~1/4 of available memory. It's even worse under
# fifo where each syncvar is ~170 bytes.
