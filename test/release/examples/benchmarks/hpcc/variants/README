====================================
Chapel HPC Challenge Codes: Variants
====================================

This directory contains variants of the Chapel HPC Challenge
benchmarks from the parent directory of this file.  These variants are
typically ones that are more elegant, but don't yet perform as well as
the main files (which are intended to serve as our entries in the
annual HPCC competition).

The main files for these benchmarks are as follows:

     stream-promoted.chpl   : global STREAM Triad using promotion
     ra-buff-atomics.chpl   : a version of RA using buffered atomic vars
     ra-cleanloop.chpl      : global RA with a cleaner update loop

The helper modules are the ones from the parent directory requiring a
-M .. on the compiler line (or an explicit naming of the module file).

Most other details are similar to the parent directory.
