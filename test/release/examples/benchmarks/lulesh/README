===============================
Chapel implementation of LULESH
===============================

This directory contains a Chapel port of the DARPA/Livermore
Unstructured Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics (LULESH)
benchmark (see https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/ShockHydro/
for details).


------
Status
------

The Chapel version of LULESH is a work-in-progress.  To the best of
our knowledge, the current form is a complete and faithful
implementation of LULESH.  That said, several improvements remain
to improve performance and elegance.  See the list below and TODO
comments in the source code for some known areas for improvement.


-------
Running
-------

In running the Chapel version of LULESH, the user must either specify
an input file via the --filename flag or a number of elements to use
per edge in a cubic data set using the --elemsPerEdge argument.  For
example, to run using a cubic 2x2x2 input set, you could either use
'--filename lmeshes/sedov2cube.lmesh' or '--elemsPerEdge 2'.  The
filename option has the advantage of supporting non-cubic input sets.

TODOs

PERFORMANCE TODOs:
------------------

* Today, the sparse subdomain MatElems is not distributed across
  multiple locales, resulting in too much memory on, and communication
  to, locale #0.  Making this distributed aligned with Elems would
  also permit enabling several commented-out local clauses.

* localizeNeighborNodes seems a little weird/inefficient.  Review its
  role and look for ways to improve.


INPUT FILE TODOs:
-----------------

* Put initial energy into input file format

* Ultimately, it would be cool to support comments in the input file
  for clarity.  These could either be required or optional.

* Seems like there should be a nicer way to read elemToNode in one
  fell swoop (or at least not a scalar at a time).  Ideally in an
  initializer so it could be const.  We could use a manual iterator,
  but it seems like it would be nice for this to "just work" in some
  way.

* At the very least, it seems like the current nested loop should be
  able to be replaced with a singleton loop and a read of a tuple.


STYLE TODOs:
------------

* It'd be nice to replace some of the groups of three arrays
  representing x, y, and z values with an array of tuples or records
  or small arrays.  The array of tuples approach seems most
  appropriate and could result in a rank-independent version of LULESH
  if that was of interest.  This seems like it could also potentially
  improve performance depending on how much the coordinates are used
  in an interleaved manner.

* Conversely, the arrays of tuples used to store elemToNode and 8*real
  variables seem like they would be more natural as arrays of arrays.
  We started using tuples for the performance benefit, but ultimately,
  there shouldn't be a performance hit for using arrays of arrays --
  we should make them perform the same and switch these back.

* Review uses of 'var' -- replace with 'const' when possible.

* (Maybe) typedef index(Elems)/index(Nodes) to be something like
  Elem/Node or something clear?

* Should the long list of constants labeled "Constants" be made into
  params or at least config consts?  (maybe some subset falls into
  each of those three categories?)

* In ApplyAccelerationBoundaryConditionsForNodes(), shouldn't we be
  able to write xdd[XSym] = 0.0 rather than using an explicit loop?

* elemToNodesTuple() is this too simple to bother writing as an
  iterator?


ACCURACY TO SPIRIT OF BENCHMARK TODOs:
--------------------------------------

* Review loops over Elems to see whether some of them should be loops
  over MatElems -- seems like the ones in EvalEOSforElems() probably
  should be for example

* courant_elem is currently unused -- is that a problem?

* ditto for dthydro_elem

* ditto for sentinel values of 1.0e+20 in original code -- did our
  rewrite using a reduction mean these could go away?

* the loop at the bottom of ApplyMaterialPropertiesForElems() doesn't
  seem to do anything?

* See question in CalcSoundSpeedForElems()
