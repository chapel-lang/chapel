===============================
Chapel implementation of miniMD
===============================

This directory contains a Chapel port of the "mini Molecular Dynamics"
(miniMD) benchmark. (see http://mantevo.org/ for the C++ reference
version and more details).

------
Status
------

The Chapel version of miniMD is a work-in-progress. To the best of our 
knowledge, the current form is an accurate implementation of most 
miniMD features. A number of improvements remain, see the TODOs section in 
this file.

Four versions of miniMD are included in this release. 

The first three are in this directory and share a single source base.
The fourth is in the explicit/ subdirectory.

* The first version is a single-locale code. It is compiled by default
  when CHPL_COMM=none.

* The second version uses the Block distribution, and is compiled by
  default when CHPL_COMM=gasnet. It is the slowest version by far, as
  the communication is performed on a very fine-grain, demand-driven
  manner.

* The third version uses a modified Block distribution
  (StencilDist.chpl), and is built by compiling with the
  'useStencilDist' config param set to true. This version optimizes
  communication by caching remote values on each locale. Thanks to the
  elegance of Chapel's distributions, most of the changes are hidden
  from the user. A significant difference is the need to manually call
  'updateFluff()', which will cache necessary neighboring values (best
  done after writing to the array).

* The fourth and final version exists in the 'explicit/'
  directory. This version is essentially an SPMD version written in
  Chapel, and served as a starting point for the StencilDist version.

This version of miniMD is not yet intended for performance
comparisons, as it was written primarily to exercise the
mini-application correctly and to explore the expression of stencils
in Chapel.  Over time, we will be improving its performance, both
through improvements to the benchmark code itself, and through more
generally applicable optimizations in Chapel.  At present, users
should not be surprised to find that this version is significantly
slower than the reference version.

-----------------------------------
Compilation Options (config params)
-----------------------------------

The following are boolean config[uration] param[eter]s for miniMD 
that can be set on the chpl compiler command line using the flag:

  chpl -s<paramName>=[true|false] ...

  paramName     default   description

* printOriginal [false] : prints the same output as the c++ reference

* printPerf     [true]  : prints the total time of the computation

* printCorrect  [false] : only print the T/U/P information (without timestamp),
                          useful when automating correctness testing

printPerf is true by default by convention in the Chapel testing system.

To mimic the original C++ output, use the following:
  -sprintOriginal=true -sprintPerf=false

Chapel-specific optimizations:

* Add the following to enable the BulkTransfer optimization:
  -sdebugBlockDistBulkTransfer -sdisableAliasedBulkTransfer=false

* tcmalloc has yielded significant performance improvements:
  As in the Chapel docs, do the following: 
    export CHPL_MEM=tcmalloc

As with all Chapel benchmarks, for the best performance, compile
miniMD with the --fast flag.


-------
Running
-------

While miniMD can read from input files, it does not require them.

For legal reasons, input files available from the C++ are not currently 
bundled with this release of miniMD. However, you are free to visit 
the mantevo website, download the reference version, and use those files.


-----------------
Execution Options
-----------------

The following are config[uration] const[ant]s thatn can be used to
modify the execution at program launch time. These can bet set on 
the execution-time command line using the following flag styles:

  ./miniMD --<constName>=<value>
  ./miniMD --<constName> <value>
  ./miniMD -s<constName>=<value>
  ./miniMD -s<constName> <value>

use the '--pHelp' flag to display a list of command line options:

* input_file: string -- set input file to be used

* numSteps: int -- set number of timesteps for simulation

* size: int -- set linear dimension of systembox

* num_bins: int -- set linear dimension of neighbor bin grid

* units: string -- set units (lj or metal)

* force: string -- set interaction mode (lj or eam)

* data_file: string -- read configuration from LAMMPS data file

----------
Vocabulary
----------

Some important vocabulary for understanding the code:
  - stencil: a fixed pattern that we use to refer to array elements 
             or data.

  - fluff: if the stencil needs to look at its nearest neighbors, then 
           on the edges of the array we will encounter an out-of-bounds 
           error. We can avoid this by extending the array's bounds 
           by the size of the stencil. The area outside of the portion 
           of the array we care about is called fluff.


---------
Debugging
---------

Some tips for resolving bugs when modifying/improving this code. These are 
mostly based off of experience, and have proved useful.

Problem size:
  I suggest testing with the arguments '--size 5 -nl 1' to start out with. If 
  you're having problems with 1 locale and such a small sample size, you're 
  going to have problems with more complex configurations. The advantages of 
  this smaller configuration are:
    less atom/bin debug output to sift through
    runs fairly quickly. Compile time is long enough, you don't want to wait
      to long for execution.
    while small, a size of 5 gives just enough to test -nl 2 as well.

A) This code currently relies on the condition that we only need to look at the 
nearest neighboring locale for ghost bins. This is influenced by simulation 
settings like problem size and cutoff. You can use the debug flag to add a line 
that writes the bin distribution and see what the program thinks it needs. 

B) Make sure neighbor lists are correct. Incorrect ghost positions, force 
computation, or binning can lead to bad neighbor lists. With a bad neighbor 
list, results can get worse and worse until a segfault.

C) Inspect the position/velocity/force of atoms (requires correct reference)

* Incorrect T/U/P results 
  - If your force computation is wrong after the 0th iteration, it's 
    possible atoms didn't end up in their correct positions. If the 
    0th iteration is wrong, there's probably an issue with buildNeighbors.

  - Make sure you're getting the data from the right Locale. This is
    more of a problem with the Stencil version, as some of the
    reading/writing is masked by the Distribution code. Printing the
    '.locale' of data can help here.

* Segfaults / Bad array accesses - With incorrect code an atom can 'shoot' out 
of the problem space before boundary conditions can be re-asserted.

TODOS
-----

CORRECTNESS TODOs:
-----------------

* Due to legal concerns, we currently do not include input files for miniMD 
in our testing system. miniMD's EAM computation relies on such an input file.
To test and run with EAM you can download the C++ reference and copy the 
appropriate files into each of the subdirectories

* Ensure command-line options behave in the same way as in c++

* Re-implement half-neighbors


PERFORMANCE TODOs:
------------------

* Identify sections of code that can benefit from a local {} assertion.

* A global 'perBinSpace' is a bit of a bottleneck. Is there a better way to 
  do this?

* Check StencilDist on 1D

* Is bulk transfer firing when we think it is?

* param loops & variables

* Compiler and runtime improvements may yield additional performance increases.

* RADOpt is currently turned off for the stencil distribution version. More 
  work needs to be done in StencilDist to support this, among some other 
  features

* Boundary iteration needs to be parallelized and optimized for communication.


MISCELLANEOUS TODOs:
--------------------

* Naming isn't the best.

* Are comments clear enough?

* yaml output
