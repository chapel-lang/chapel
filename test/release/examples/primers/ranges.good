Unbounded ranges
Range 1.. = 1, 2, 3, ...
Range ..5 = ..., 3, 4, 5
Range .. = all integers, increasing

Iterating over zip(312..315, 1..) generates
 (312, 1) (313, 2) (314, 3) (315, 4)

Ranges over bools and enums:
Range false..true = false, true
Range north..west = north, south, east, west
Range orange..green = orange, yellow, green

Range false.. = false, true
Range south.. = south, east, west
Range ..indigo by -1 = indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red

The count operator
Range 0..4 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
Range 1..4 = 1, 2, 3, 4
Range 3..5 = 3, 4, 5

Strided ranges using the by operator
Range 1..10 by 2 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Range 1..10 by 4 = 1, 5, 9
Range 1..10 by -1 = 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Range 5.. by 2 = 5, 7, 9, ...

Examples mixing # and by
Range 1..8 by 2 = 1, 3, 5, 7
Range 1..4 by 2 = 1, 3
Range 3..10 by -2 = 10, 8, 6, 4
Range 1..4 by -2 = 4, 2
Range 3..10 by 2 = 3, 5, 7, 9
Range 7..10 by 2 = 7, 9
Range 1..8 by -2 = 8, 6, 4, 2
Range 7..10 by -2 = 10, 8

Implicit alignment set using 'by'
Range 1..10 by 2 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Range 1..10 by -2 = 10, 8, 6, 4, 2
Range ..5 by -3 = 5, 2, -1, ...

Range alignment and the align operator
Range 1..10 by 2 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
Range 1..10 by 2 align 0 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
Range .. by 2 align 1
Range .. by 2 align 0

Operators + and -
Range 6..15 = 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
Range -2..7 = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
