chpldoc.doc.chpl:31: warning: This file-scope code is outside of any explicit module declarations (e.g., module Defined), so an implicit module named 'chpldoc.doc' is being introduced to contain the file's contents.
chpldoc.doc

Usage:
   use chpldoc.doc;

or

   import chpldoc.doc;

Submodules for this module are located in the chpldoc.doc/ directory

   proc commented(val: int): string
      
      Multiline comments found before a function are associated with that function
      as long as there are no code blocks between them.

   proc stub(val): bool
      
      The function can be a stub and still output its comment

   proc uncommented()
Defined

Usage:
   use chpldoc.doc.Defined;

or

   import chpldoc.doc.Defined;

   
   If the source code defines a module, it can also have a comment associated
   with it
   Class: Foo
      
      And classes can display their comments, too
      

      var a: int
         
         Including the comments associated with their fields
         
      proc getA(): int
         
         And class specific methods
         

   Class: Bar : Foo
      
      If a class inherits from another class, the inheritance is shown
      in the signature.
      

      proc setA(newVal: int)
