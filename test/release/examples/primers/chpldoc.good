Module: chpldoc
   proc commented(val: int): string
      
      Multiline comments found before a function are associated with that function
      as long as there are no code blocks between them.

   proc stub(val): bool
      
      The function can be a stub and still output its comment

   proc uncommented()
   Module: chpldoc.Defined
      
      If the source code defines a module, it can also have a comment associated
      with it
      Class: Foo
         
         And classes can display their comments, too
         

         var a: int
            
            Including the comments associated with their fields
            
         proc getA(): int
            
            And class specific methods
            

      Class: Bar : Foo
         
         If a class inherits from another class, those fields, methods, and their
         comments are output in both the super and the subclass
         

         proc setA(newVal: int)
