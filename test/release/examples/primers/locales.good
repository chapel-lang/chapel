This program is running on 4 locales
It began running on locale #0

hello locale 0
hello locale 1
hello locale 2
hello locale 3

MyLocaleArray[1] is really locale 0
MyLocaleArray[2] is really locale 1
MyLocaleArray[3] is really locale 2
MyLocaleArray[4] is really locale 3
MyLocaleArray[5] is really locale 0
MyLocaleArray[6] is really locale 1
MyLocaleArray[7] is really locale 2
MyLocaleArray[8] is really locale 3
MyLocaleArray[9] is really locale 0
MyLocaleArray[10] is really locale 1


From locale 1, x is: 2 and y is: 3
From locale 0, x is: 2 and y is: 3

x is stored on locale 0, while y lives on 1

Using a data-driven on-clause, I'm now executing on locale 0

at start of 'on', myData is on locale 0
at end of 'on', myData is on locale 1
after 'on', myData is on locale 1
Using 'on myData', I'm now executing on locale 1
