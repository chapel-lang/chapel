// Sparse Domains and Arrays

/*
   This primer shows off some of Chapel's support for sparse domains
   and arrays.

*/


//
// First, we declare a configuration variable, ``n``, which defines the
// problem size for this example.  It's given a default value of ``9``,
// which can be over-ridden on the executable's command line using:
// ``--n=<value>``.
//
config var n = 9;


//
// Sparse domains in Chapel are defined in terms of a bounding domain.
// The role of this bounding domain is to define the range of legal
// indices for the sparse domain.  Here we declare a dense 2D
// rectangular bounding domain of ``n x n`` indices which will serve as the
// index space for the sparse domain/array in our example.  As we will
// see, it will also be useful for operations that want to treat our
// sparse domain as though it was a dense ``n x n`` set of values.
//
const dnsDom = {1..n, 1..n};

//
// Here we declare our sparse domain.  The sparse keyword indicates
// that it will be used to only represent a subset of its bounding
// domain's indices, and that arrays declared using it will store a
// *zero value* (described further below) for all indices in the set
// ``dnsDom - spsDom``.  Because we don't initialize the sparse domain, it
// is initially an empty set of indices.
//
var spsDom: sparse subdomain(dnsDom);

//
// Next, we use the sparse domain to declare a sparse array.  This
// uses Chapel's normal array declaration syntax.
//
var spsArr: [spsDom] real;


//
// I/O on sparse domains and arrays only prints out *non-vero values*;
// initially there are none, so these will both print in a degenerate manner.
//
writeln("Initially, spsDom is: ", spsDom);
writeln("Initially, spsArr is: ", spsArr);
writeln();


//
// We can also do I/O more explicitly by iterating over the dense
// domain and indexing into the sparse array.  Note that it's legal to
// index into a sparse array in either its *zero* or *nonzero*
// positions; however it's only legal to assign to *nonzero*
// positions, since those are the only ones that are explicitly
// stored.
//
proc writeSpsArr() {
  for (i,j) in dnsDom {
    write(spsArr(i,j), " ");
    if (j == n) then writeln();
  }
  writeln();
}


//
// Let's try that procedure we just wrote:
//
writeln("Printing spsArr with a dense representation:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// Chapel's sparse arrays store the element type's default value for
// their *zero value* by default -- so ``0`` for numerical types,
// empty strings for strings, ``nil`` references for classes, etc.
// However, a different value can be stored at *zero* positions
// instead which is why we don't refer to it as the *zero value* and
// rather as the *IRV* or *Implicitly Replicated Value*.  This value can
// be changed for a given array by assigning to that array's *IRV*
// field, allowing a more interesting value/string/class instance to
// be stored at all the *nonzero* values.
//
spsArr.IRV = 7.7;
writeln("Printing spsArr after changing its IRV:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// OK, now let's actually add some sparse indices to the ``DaSps`` domain
// and see what happens:
//
spsDom += (1,n);
spsDom += (n,n);
spsDom += (1,1);
spsDom += (n,1);

writeln("Printing spsArr after adding the corner indices:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// It appears as though nothing happened, but in fact it did.  The
// sparse domain spsDom was reallocated to store the four new (corner)
// indices; the sparse array was reallocated to allocate storage for
// the four new elements corresponding to those indices; and those
// elements were initialized to store the *IRV*, since that's the
// logical value that they were representing before the new sparse
// indices "filled in".  We can see this difference by going back to
// the default sparse I/O:
//
writeln("After adding corners, spsDom is:\n", spsDom);
writeln("After adding corners, spsArr is:\n", spsArr);
writeln();


//
// Or by assigning the array elements corresponding to the corners
// and using our dense printing procedure:
//
proc computeVal(row, col) return row + col/10.0;

spsArr(1,1) = computeVal(1,1);
spsArr(1,n) = computeVal(1,n);
spsArr(n,1) = computeVal(n,1);
spsArr(n,n) = computeVal(n,n);

writeln("Printing spsArr after assigning the corner elements:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// Values can only be assigned to array positions that are members in
// the sparse domain index set.  The boolean method Domain.member(x)
// can be used to check whether a certain index ``(x)`` is a member of the
// domain's index set. Note that, in multi-dimensional domains, the member
// method can accept the index as a tuple like ``spsDom.member((i,j))``
// or as a parameter list like ``spsDom.member(i,j)``. Below, we print ``*`` for
// the positions that are members in the sparse domain, and ``.`` otherwise.
//
writeln("Positions that are members in the sparse domain are marked by a '*':");

for (i,j) in dnsDom {
  if spsDom.member(i,j) then
    write("* "); // (i,j) is a member in the sparse index set
  else
    write(". "); // (i,j) is not a member in the sparse index set

  if (j == n) then writeln();
}
writeln();

//
// Like other domains and arrays, sparse Chapel domains and arrays can
// be iterated over...
//

writeln("Iterating over spsDom and indexing into spsArr:");
for ij in spsDom do
  writeln("spsArr(", ij, ") = ", spsArr(ij));
writeln();

writeln("Iterating over spsArr:");
for a in spsArr do
  writeln(a, " ");
writeln();


//
// ...reductions can be taken...
//
var sparseSum = + reduce spsArr;
var denseSum = + reduce [ij in dnsDom] spsArr(ij);

writeln("the sum of the sparse elements is: ", sparseSum);
writeln("the sum of the dense elements is: ", denseSum);
writeln();

//
// ...and slices will be allowed to be taken (sparse slices of dense
// arrays, dense slices of sparse arrays, sparse slices of sparse
// arrays, etc.), but those aren't implemented yet...
//


//
// OK, let's clear things out and start again, this time defining a
// sparse domain whose diagonal elements are represented.
//
spsDom.clear();     // empty the sparse index set
spsArr.IRV = 0.0;   // reset the IRV

for i in 1..n do
  spsDom += (i,i);

[(i,j) in spsDom] spsArr(i,j) = computeVal(i,j);

writeln("Printing spsArr after resetting and adding the diagonal:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// Here are some other ways to enumerate sparse indices.  You can
// assign a sparse domain a tuple of indices:
//

spsDom.clear();
spsDom = ((1,1), (n/2, n/2), (n,n));

[(i,j) in spsDom] spsArr(i,j) = computeVal(i,j);

writeln("Printing spsArr after resetting and assigning a tuple of indices:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// You can also define an iterator and have it generate the sparse
// indices:
//

iter antiDiag(n) {
  for i in 1..n do
    yield (i, n-i+1);
}

spsDom = antiDiag(n);

[(i,j) in spsDom] spsArr(i,j) = computeVal(i,j);

writeln("Printing spsArr after resetting and assigning the antiDiag iterator:");
writeSpsArr();


//
// We'll close with a brief note on performance: Chapel's default
// single-locale sparse format represents the domain using a dense
// sorted vector of explicitly represented indices and the array using
// a dense vector of elements.  This format is general, meaning that
// we can support 1D, 2D, 3D, ..., nD sparse domains and arrays in
// addition to the 2D case shown here.  However, it is also very
// general, which is why we use it.  As Chapel continues to develop, it
// will support additional sparse formats that make various tradeoffs
// in efficiency and representation as part of its standard
// distribution library.  In addition, advanced users will be able to
// define their own sparse domain/array representations using the
// user-defined distribution capability.
//
// Regardless of the sparse format used, operations over a sparse
// domain's indices or sparse array's elements should typically be
// proportional to the number of nonzeroes ``(nnz)`` rather than the size
// of the dense bounding box.  Operations like inserting new indices
// or testing for membership will tend to vary depending on the
// representation.
//
// For example, in the default representation, adding indices in
// reverse sorted order will require O(nnz**2) time due to all of the
// insertions required.  For this reason, users are encouraged to add
// indices in sorted order when performance matters.
//
// Other general rules of thumb when working with sparse domains and
// arrays is to make the domains constant (const) whenever possible,
// setting their index set in their initializer using a forall
// expression or iterator invocation; and to assign sparse domain
// indices before declaring arrays over those sparse domains when
// possible (to avoid reallocating the arrays more than is necessary.
// While the choice of a sparse representations may make the impact of
// these decisions more or less crucial, they are good general rules
// of thumb.
//
// As a final performance-related note, there are several important
// compiler optimizations that remain unimplemented for sparse domains
// and arrays.  Today's implementation is meant to expose users to
// Chapel's sparse concepts, but additional performance will be added
// over time.
//
// Anyone reading this far who is interested in exploring more with
// sparse domains and arrays in Chapel is encouraged to contact us at
// chapel_info@cray.com.  We currently have a Compressed Sparse Row
// (CSR) sparse domain/array layout within our modules and an
// implementation of the NAS CG benchmark that makes use of it, and
// would be happy to provide the curious with full explanations of
// the features therein, and are open to new suggestions.
