=====================
Chapel Testing System
=====================

In addition to the code files themselves, this directory contains
files used by our regression testing infrastructure to automatically
compile, run, and test sample codes.  For a test foo.chpl, the
following files may also exist:

     foo.compopts   : command-line options to be used when compiling the test
     foo.execopts   : command-line options to be used when executing the test
     foo.good       : the expected output for the test
     foo.notest     : indicates that foo.chpl should not be tested 
                      (e.g., because it is a helper module)
     foo.perfkeys   : indicates keys that are used to identify values of
                      interest in performance-oriented runs


---------------------
Using the test system
---------------------

To launch the test system, make sure you're in the examples directory
and run:

     ./start_test

This will cause all of the tests in this directory to be compiled and
executed in a correctness-testing mode, printing out a summary at the
end and creating log files for the test run in a Logs/ subdirectory.

You can also run the testing system in a performance-oriented mode
using:

     ./start_test -performance

This executes tests that have a .perfkeys file and places the
performance results flagged by the list of keys into a file under the
test's directory named perfdat/<machine_name>/<test_name>.dat.

Some other useful ways to run the test system are:

     start_test -startdir <directory>
     start_test -onetest <foo.chpl>

These commands run the test system starting from a single directory,
or on a single test, respectively.

For a list of other test system options, use:

     start_test -help
