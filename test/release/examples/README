====================
Chapel Example Codes
====================

This directory contains a few simple "Hello, world!" example codes to
get started with Chapel program structure:

     hello.chpl             : simplest Chapel "Hello, world!" program
     hello-module.chpl      : a variation using a more structured use of Chapel
     hello-multiloc.chpl    : a multi-locale "Hello, world!" program

It also contains a number of targeted examples---many written in a
tutorial style---to help get started with specific Chapel language
features:

     arrays.chpl            : tutorial for Chapel arithmetic arrays/domains
     fileIO.chpl            : simple file I/O example using arrays
     iterators.chpl         : sample iterators
     multilocale.chpl       : demonstration of multi-locale concepts
     opaque.chpl            : tutorial for Chapel opaque arrays
     reductions.chpl        : applies several array reductions on a 2D array
     slices.chpl            : examples of array slicing and reindexing
     sparse.chpl            : sparse domain/array tutorial example
     taskParallel.chpl      : introduces task parallel language concepts
     varargs.chpl           : demonstration of variable argument functions

A number of other examples show some simple computations in Chapel
that exercise various language features:

     beer.chpl              : computes lyrics to "99 bottles of beer"
     genericStack.chpl      : generic stack classes (list- and array-based)
     jacobi.chpl            : Jacobi iteration
     linkedList.chpl        : generic linked list example
     norm.chpl              : sample module for computing array norms
     prodCons.chpl          : producer-consumer example using circular buffer
     quicksort.chpl         : parallel quick sort using cobegin and serial
     tree.chpl              : constructs and walks a tree in parallel

The hpcc subdirectory contains Chapel versions of three HPC Challenge
benchmarks:

     stream.chpl            : the STREAM Triad benchmark
     ra.chpl                : the global Random Access benchmark
     fft.chpl               : the global 1D FFT benchmark
     hpl.chpl               : the High Performance Linpack benchmark

If you are interested in a specific Chapel feature, refer to
README.features, which contains a map of which tests use which
language features.


------------------
Building the tests
------------------

The examples in this directory can be compiled in a standalone manner,
for example, the canonical "Hello, world!" program can be compiled as
follows:

     chpl -o hello hello.chpl

The hpcc benchmarks each use multiple source files -- see hpcc/README
for details.

We provide Makefiles in each directory that can be used to build a
single test in that directory by name:

     gmake hello

or to build all tests in that directory and its subdirectories:

     gmake all
