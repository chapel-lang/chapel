============================================
Chapel Examples Directory and Testing System
============================================

This directory contains the following example codes:

     beer.chpl              : computes lyrics to "99 bottles of beer"
     blockLU.chpl           : block LU factorization
     genericStack.chpl      : generic stack classes (list- and array-based)
     hello.chpl             : "Hello, world!" program using a config variable
     iterators.chpl         : sample iterators
     jacobi.chpl            : Jacobi iteration
     norm.chpl              : sample module for computing array norms
     parallelQuickSort.chpl : parallel quick sort using cobegin and serial
     prod-cons.chpl         : producer-consumer using a sync variable
     tree_construct.chpl    : construct and walk a tree in parallel

The hpcc06 directory contains Chapel versions of the HPC Challenge
benchmarks:

     stream.chpl            : our global STREAM Triad entry
     ra.chpl                : our global Random Access entry
     ra-randstream.chpl     : the random stream generator for our RA entry
     fft.chpl               : our global 1D FFT entry
     probSize.chpl          : a common module for computing problem sizes
     fft-mta.chpl           : a port of the 2005 Konecny, Kahan, Feo entry
     fft-testPow4.chpl      : an empty test used to exercise fft.chpl in our
                              testing system for non-powers-of-two

Most of the examples can be compiled in a standalone manner, for
example, the canonical "Hello, world!" program can be compiled as
follows:

     chpl -o hello hello.chpl

The hpcc06 tests are an exception -- they use multiple modules defined
using multiple source files.  They can be compiled using the following
commands:

     chpl -o stream probSize.chpl stream.chpl
     chpl -o ra probSize.chpl ra-randstream.chpl ra.chpl
     chpl -o fft probSize.chpl fft.chpl
     chpl -o fft-mta probSize.chpl fft-mta.chpl

We provide Makefiles in each directory that can be used to build a
single test in that directory by name:

     make hello

or to build all tests in that directory and its subdirectories:

     make all


--------------------------------
Files related to the test system
--------------------------------

In addition to the code files themselves, this directory contains
files used by our regression testing infrastructure to automatically
compile, run, and test sample codes.  For a test foo.chpl, the
following files may also exist:

     foo.compopts   : command-line options to be used when compiling the test
     foo.execopts   : command-line options to be used when executing the test
     foo.good       : the expected output for the test
     foo.notest     : indicates that foo.chpl should not be tested 
                      (e.g., because it is a helper module)


---------------------
Using the test system
---------------------

To launch the test system, cd into the examples directory and use:

     start_test

This will cause all of the tests in this directory to be compiled and
executed, printing out a summary at the end and creating log files of
the test run in a Logs/ subdirectory.  Some other useful ways to run
the test system are:

     start_test -startdir <dir>
     start_test -onetest <foo.chpl>

These commands run the test system starting from a single directory,
or on a single test, respectively.  For a list of other test system
options, use:

     start_test -help

And for complete documentation on the testing system, refer to the
comments at the top of the start_test file.
