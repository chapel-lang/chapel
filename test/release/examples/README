====================
Chapel Example Codes
====================

This directory contains a few simple "Hello, world!" example codes to
get started with Chapel program structure:

     hello.chpl             : simplest Chapel "Hello, world!" program
     hello-module.chpl      : a variation using a more structured use of Chapel
     hello-multiloc.chpl    : a multi-locale "Hello, world!" program

It also contains subdirectories that contain more interesting
examples:

     tutorials/             : introduce Chapel concepts using a narrative flow
     programs/              : demonstrate Chapel using small programs
     hpcc/                  : implementations of the HPC Challenge benchmarks

See the READMEs in each subdirectory for a description of its
examples.

If you are interested in finding examples that use a specific Chapel
feature, refer to README.features, which contains a map of which tests
demonstrate which language features.


------------------
Building the tests
------------------

Most of the examples can be compiled without referring to any
additional source files.  For example, the canonical "Hello, world!"
program can be compiled as follows:

     chpl -o hello hello.chpl

The hpcc benchmarks each use multiple source files -- see hpcc/README
for details.

We provide Makefiles in each directory that can be used to build a
single test in that directory by name:

     gmake hello

Alternatively, you can build all the tests in a directory and its
subdirectories:

     gmake all
