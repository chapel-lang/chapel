====================
Chapel Example Codes
====================

This directory contains a few simple "Hello, world!" example codes to
get started with Chapel program structure:

     hello.chpl               : a one-line Chapel "Hello, world!" program
     hello2-module.chpl       : a more structured "Hello, world!" program
     hello3-datapar.chpl      : a data parallel version of "Hello, World!"
     hello4-datapar-dist.chpl : a distributed data parallel version
     hello5-taskpar.chpl      : a task parallel version of "Hello, World!"
     hello6-taskpar-dist.chpl : a distributed task parallel version

It also contains subdirectories that contain more interesting
examples:

     benchmarks/  : contains standard benchmarks written in Chapel
     patterns/    : examples demonstrating common tasks
     primers/     : introduce Chapel concepts narratively for new users
     programs/    : demonstrate Chapel using small programs/idioms
     spec/        : example codes from the Chapel Specification (see below)
     users-guide/ : example codes from the Chapel Users Guide

Each subdirectory (except users-guide and spec) includes its own README file
with additional information on those examples.


------------------------
The spec directory tests
------------------------

The tests in the spec directory are automatically extracted from
selected examples in the Chapel Specification.  The examples for a
particular chapter are in a directory specified by the chapter name
(e.g., Arrays) and the name of the test is in parenthesis after the
word "Example" in the spec.  Often times, additional code has been
added to make the code a complete, testable program.


------------------
Building the tests
------------------

Most of the examples can be compiled without explicitly listing any
additional source files.  For example, the canonical "Hello, world!"
program can be compiled as follows:

     chpl -o hello hello.chpl

We provide Makefiles in each directory that can be used to build a
single test in that directory by name:

     gmake hello

Alternatively, you can build all the tests in a directory and its
subdirectories by simply using:

     gmake
