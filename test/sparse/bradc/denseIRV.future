error message: array method candidates

At the time of this writing, this test yields the following output:

denseIRV.chpl:4: error: unresolved call ':[domain(2,int,0)] int.IRV() = :int'
$CHPL_HOME/modules/standard/ChapelArray.chpl:351: note: candidates are: :_array.IRV

It seems to me that the ChapelArray candidates should not be listed
because they're part of an internal module -- something the user
should not be reasoning about.  I don't have a huge problem with the
SingleLocaleSparseArray candidates being printed out, but if they
could be filtered as well (based on the type of the "this" pointer),
that would be even better.  In short, calling x.foo() for a class x
that doesn't have a method named foo() doesn't seem like it should
result in every foo() in the program being printed out as a candidate.
