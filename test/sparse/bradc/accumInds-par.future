feature request: thread-safe sparse distributions

We should make our sparse distributions reader/writer thread-safe by
default in order to improve sanity for parallel operations on them
while also providing the user with the ability to turn this off if
they know they're using them in a thread-safe manner.

I forced this to fail because it was a race-y future otherwise,
which generated a lot of noise.
