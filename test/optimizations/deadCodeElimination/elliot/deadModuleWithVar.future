feature request: Eliminate dead modules that only contain dead variables.

This future is intended to capture when dead modules with dead variables are
successfully eliminated. Currently modules will not be eliminated if they have
variables, even if those variables are dead because global variables are never
candidates for dead code elimination.

Once global variables are candidate for dead code elimination, this serves to
test that dead modules with only dead variables are eliminated.
