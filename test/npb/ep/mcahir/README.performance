The reference version of EP for the largest size (size D) takes ~2,400 seconds
on a desktop machine.  For a good balance of reasonable comparison numbers 
versus performance tests taking too long, it would be optimal for Chapel's
version to be allowed to run for ~7,200 seconds.

To save ourselves time when running the entire performance directory, we are
lowering the timeout to ~5 minutes and are no longer running size C and D
because it is guaranteed to time out.  When someone chooses to look into EP
performance, they may restore the running of this problem size.  We have also
turned off graph generation in the meanwhile.
