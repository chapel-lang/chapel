/* 
   NAS Parallel Benchmarks 
   "Embarrassingly Parallel"
   
   This is a Chapel implementation of the embarrassingly parallel benchmark.
   It uses the Chapel pseudo-random number generator, which is modeled after 
   the NAS linear congruential generator. Due to the different structure of 
   the Chapel language, this implementation has a noticeably different structure
   than the Fortan reference version. However, attempts were made to keep it
   aligned with the reference implementation with respect to the work that is
   done and the results that are reported. For example, while this version uses
   Chapel's "reduce" statement, the iterator that is reduced on still generates
   a "batch" of 2^16 random numbers before quantifying the gaussian pairs in
   the set.
 
   This 'elegant' version attempts to express the EP benchmark as succintly
   and readably as possible. This means that it does not perform quite as 
   well as the base Chapel implementation (about 2x slower), but because this
   implementation relies more on Chapel constructs such as "reduce", future
   implementations of the Chapel compiler and runtime could possibly make
   greater improvements in this version's performance.
