The reference version for the largest size of FT we can run (size B) takes
~100 seconds to complete.  The Chapel version of this size takes roughly 500
seconds to complete, so we should let it go around 1000 just to be safe.

Note: when the timeout was extended to 1000, on chap03 and bradc-lnx size C and
size D run out of memory instead of just timing out, although size C completed
on chap04.  Those problem sizes have now been disabled, in part because of this
and also because the reference version does not run on those sizes either.
