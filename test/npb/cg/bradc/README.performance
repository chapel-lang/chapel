Currently, we run cg-sparse.chpl for performance testing, using the same
compopts as the correctness version.  The reference version of CG on the
largest size we can run currently (size C) takes ~1,100 seconds to complete
on a desktop machine.  Thus, to ensure we get any comparison values, 
cg-sparse.chpl must be allowed to run for at least 3,000 seconds, if not more.
However, we know that cg-sparse probably times out for size B and C for the
current implementation (revision 21580).  Which means performance testing
will take a very long time.

Since size B, C and D timeout so ridiculously, there isn't much point having
testing on them until someone is actually working on improving their
performance, so we turned them off as of 10/03/13
