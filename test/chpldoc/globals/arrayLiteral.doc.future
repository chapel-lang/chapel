bug: chpldoc output for the for loop creation of arrays is awful

Chpldoc doesn't know what to do with the AST generated by this program.  We
get a function created at the scope of the initialization expression and
manage to output that function prior to the variable it is used for (when
chpldoc likely shouldn't go into that expression in the first place).  Then,
when chpldoc does try to output the initialization portion of the variable, it
falls into an unhandled edge case of AstToText because we don't expect anything
other than a SymExpr or UnresolvedSymExpr.

This failure also impacts array type aliases (see arrayTypeAlias.doc.future)
