===========
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use methods.doc;

.. class:: fullOfMethods

   .. method:: proc commented()

      This is just a normal method with a comment.  I shouldn't
      need to test various other forms of methods, because those
      are tested elsewhere 

   .. method:: proc commentless()

.. record:: fullOfMethodsToo

   .. method:: proc commented()

      This is just a normal method with a comment.  I shouldn't
      need to test various other forms of methods, because those
      are tested elsewhere 

   .. method:: proc commentless()
