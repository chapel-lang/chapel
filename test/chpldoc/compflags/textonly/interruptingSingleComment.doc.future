bug: accidentally grabs multiline comment even with intervening single line comment

chpldoc intentionally grabs multiline comments that precede a symbol, no matter
the intervening space.  However, if there is an intervening single line or
otherwise non-documentation comment, it probably shouldn't assume that the
multiline comment is relevant.
