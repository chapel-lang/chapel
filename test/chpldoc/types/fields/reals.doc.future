bug: default values for reals dropped in chpldoc

When attempting to display a real with a defined default value, chpldoc
understands that a default value is present (and so generates an "= ") but does
not know how to output its value.  This is because the pretty printer for
VarSymbols that wrap Immediates is incomplete, which is partially a result of
Immediates only defining a "type_value" method for ints, uints, and bools, but
none for reals, complexes or imags.

Action items:
We need to revisit/improve the role of Immediates in the compiler
We need to finish transitioning chpldoc from using prettyPrint to expanding
  and using AstToText.
