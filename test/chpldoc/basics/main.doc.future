bug: chpldoc documents symbols at scopes where it should not

A poorly written module with "side effects" -- i.e. loops, begins, etc at the
module scope -- is not handled correctly by chpldoc. chpldoc traverses and
documents symbols that are part of the loop scope or conditional scope.

The begin and cobegin are traversed, which is incorrect. If/When begin and
cobegin have their own AST nodes and visitor methods, it will be easier to
block their traversal.

Also, a number of tmp and iterator vars show up in the module scope. Presumably
these come from the the loops, and it would be nice to stifle them somehow.
