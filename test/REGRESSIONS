# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.
#
# Each category represents a Cron run that we do nightly and mail to
# chapel-test-results-all (and chapel-test-results-regressions if
# anything unusual happened.  The label for each category should match
# the unique ID of that testing configuration.  In some cases,
# categories will have a wildcard name such as 'gasnet*' implying that
# they are an abstract category for all configurations that match that
# pattern.  In the past we have used specific instances (like
# 'gasnet-everything', historically) for such purposes, but in
# practice there often isn't a test configuration that serves as a
# good root for the hierarchy described in the next paragraph.
#
# There is an informal hierarchy embedded in this file in order to try
# and reduce redundancy in which each suite is marked as inheriting
# from one or more other suites.  For example, if "hello.chpl" fails
# everywhere, it should only be noted in "general regressions" (the
# root of the hierarchy) and not in every configuration.  Similarly,
# if something fails for every gasnet configuration, it can be listed
# in gasnet-everything which forms the root of the gasnet sub-tree.
#
# Ultimately, the hope is to do more of this filtering and
# categorization automatically, but for the time being it is manual
# and rotated among members of the core Chapel team.  Periodically,
# all failures in a test suite should be reviewed with what's in this
# file to ensure that they match.  The last time that this full review
# was done is marked in the "Reviewed" slot in the header of the
# category.
#
# Each regression itself should be marked with a brief (one-line)
# description of why the failure is occurring, the date on which the
# failure occurred, and the owner.  All new issues should be assigned
# an owner; some historical ones may have escaped being assigned one.
#
# In some cases, more extensive notes may be in order, but this file
# should lean towards being spare (for the purposes of maintenance).
# Soon we will have an issue tracker in which each regression will
# be tracked and dialogue, notes, etc. can take place there.
#
# In some cases, if a bunch of failures share the same behavior but
# come and go on different nights, dates may be attached to the tests
# themselves rather than the failure category.  Use judgement and
# taste.
#
# Sporadic timeouts are an ongoing concern about how to track them.
# As of this writing, I am tracking them here, because there are not
# so many that it's unwieldy, but ultimately we may need to come up
# with a better plan.  Ultimately, we should quiet down all such
# sporadic timeouts, for instance by upping the timeout for a specific
# test or configuration (slow machine or back-end compiler, e.g.)

# approximation to priority order.  Formatting for each entry can be
# loose, but should roughly follow the format of brief note on why the
# test is failing followed by a list of tests that are failing for
# that reason.  If someone owns a particular regression, their name
# can be added to the description as well.
# The path to each test should appear here, so it can be be grepped for.
# The convention here is to include the entire error message, with [].
# Except if a lot of test fail for the identical reason or in the same
# directory, a wildcard is more appropriate.
# The date the entry is added is also useful.
#
# The status of failing future tests is detailed in ../STATUS.devel
