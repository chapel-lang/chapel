# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.
#
# The file itself is divided into several major sections, set off by
# *****'s: General Issues, Principal platforms, Desktop performance,
# etc.  These are designed to provide a loose, broad structure to the
# file.
#
# Each section contains a number of categories, set off by ===='s.
# Categories either correspond to a concrete test configuration that
# we run nightly, or it is an abstract category that represents some
# characteristic like "32-bit platforms" (*32) or "gasnet
# configurations" (gasnet*).  Abstract categories have wildcards in
# their name.  Concrete category labels match the subject lines of the
# nightly cron mails sent to chapel-test-results-all and
# chapel-test-results-regressions.
#
# Each category contains a list of issues, which are a description
# followed by --------'s followed by a list of the failures which are
# failing with that issue.  Within each category, issues are divided
# into those that occur regularly vs. those that occur sporadically
# via a "=== sporadic failures below ===" separator.
#
# There is a hierarchy embedded between categories via their
# "Inherits" labels.  For example, the 'cygwin32' configuration
# inherits both from 'cygwin*' (issues specific to cygwin) and from
# '*32' (issues specific to 32-bit platforms).  The goal of this
# inheritance is to reduce redundancy in listing issues and to tie
# issues to the specific aspects of testing that trigger them (e.g.,
# "this is an issue that is specific to 32-bit platforms" or "...to
# multi-locale executions").  The root of the hierarchy is the
# "general" category which would indicate something that fails
# everywhere (e.g., someone committed a syntax error to hello.chpl) or
# in enough configurations that there isn't a more nautral root
# category.
#
# Ultimately, the hope is to do more of this filtering and
# categorization automatically, but for the time being it is manual
# and rotated among members of the core Chapel team.  On a weekly
# basis, all failures in this file should be compared against what's
# being reported in nightly testing to ensure that they match 1:1
# (i.e., no failures are listed here that are not showing up in the
# nightly runs; and everything showing up in the nightly runs is
# listed here) Upon reviewing a category in this way, update the
# "Reviewed" date listed in its header.
#
# Each issue itself should be marked with a brief description
# indicating the nature of the issue, the date on which it first
# showed up, and the owner of the issue (generally, all new issues
# should be assigned an owner; some historical cases may have predated
# the assignment of owners).  For example:
#
# new RandomStream changes cause segfaults (2015-03-08, bradc)
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# [Error matching program output for test/modules/random/complex]
#
# If a failure is being described in an abstract category and it
# occurs in some configurations but not others, a list of the
# configurations can be given in a second line before the label.
# For example, under 'general' one might say:
#
# bad commit broke some hpcc tests (2015-03-08, bradc)
# (linux64, cygwin64, cygwin32, gasnet.fifo, gasnet-fast)
# -------------------------------------------------------
# [Error matching program output for test/release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/stream]
# [Error matching program output for test/release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/ra]
#
# Generally speaking, this file shouldn't be used to accumulate notes
# on an issue or testing configuration.  Such notes should be tracked
# by the issues owner or in Pivotal rather than in this file.
#
# For sporadic failures, the dates that the failure was seen should be
# listed after the test itself rather than in the category.  For
# example:
#
# Sporadic execution timeouts (bradc)
# -----------------------------------
# [Error: Timed out executing program test/npb/cg/bradc/cg-sparse]
#   (2015-03-04..2015-03-06)
# [Error: Timed out executing program test/npb/mg/mg-annotated]
#   (2015-03-01, 2015-03-05..)
#
# The first entry above indicates that we saw the timeout on March
# 4th, 5th, and 6th, but that it resolved on the 7th.  The second
# indicates that we saw a failure on the 1st (which resolved on the
# next run), and then saw it happen again on the 5th, but that it has
# not yet resolved.
#
# When sporadic failures are listed in a category that's inherited, it
# can be more difficult to track the comings and goings of the failure
# since it may fail at different times in different configurations.
# In such cases, we've taken the approach of listing the configurations
# in which the failure takes place followed by the dates on which it
# occurred:
#
# Sporadic execution timeouts
# ---------------------------
# [Error: Timed out executing program test/npb/cg/bradc/cg-sparse]
#   (xc.ugni-qthreads.gnu: 2015-03-06)
#   (xc.aries.gnu.aprun: 2015-03-08..)
#
# Sporadic failures should be removed when (a) someone has committed a
# change with the goal of removing that failure mode and it appears to
# have worked, or (b) when the issue has not been seen for a month.
# Garbage collecting such cases should be part of the once-a-week
# check to make sure that all categories reflect reality.
#
# Here's a loose algorithm for updating this file when doing triage:
#
# For each mail that comes in on test-results-regressions:
#   If the mail came in because of a new failure:
#
#     As background, seach this file to find other cases where this test fails
#
#     If that test is an already known sporadic failure:
#       If the test is in a concrete category:
#         Update the dates to reflect the new failure
#       If the test is in an abstract category:
#         Update the "last seen" information for the test
#
#     If the test is a known stable failure in some other category:
#       If the two categories are related:
#         Consider moving the issue to a shared inherited category
#       otherwise:
#         Create a new issue in the category in which the test failed
#         Or, in an appropriate parent category if it fails in several configs
#
#   If the mail came in because of a new passing test:
#
#     If that test is an already known sporadic failure:
#       If the test is in a concrete category:
#         Update the dates to reflect the test's passing
#       If the test is in an abstract category:
#         Nothing needs to be done
#
#     If the test is listed as a stable failure:
#       If the test has been resolved
#         Remove the test (and its issue, if it's now empty)
#       If the test has not been resolved
#         Move it from the stable to the sporadic part of the category
#
#   If a future is listed as passing:
#     Find an owner to either retire the future or tighten it up
#       (This is most typically the person who filed the future or
#        the person who fixed it).
#     Don't bother tracking such cases in this file
#
# Once per triage rotation:
#   Iterate through the mails generated by all configurations
#     Make sure that all issues reported are covered by this file
#     Make sure all issues in this file are showing up in testing
#     Update the "Reviewed" date for all such categories
#
#   Check through the sporadic failures to see whether any are at
#     least one month old and can be retired
