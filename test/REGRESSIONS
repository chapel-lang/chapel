# USAGE: the intent of this file is to keep track of current
# regressions and to keep notes about why they are failing.  Since
# linux is our main platform, linux regressions are listed first, and
# will typically apply to all other platforms as well.  Variations on
# linux (linux with valgrind and linux64) are listed next.  Other
# platforms follow, listed alphabetically.  Regressions that are not
# found on linux should be listed under the platforms in question.
# Formatting for each entry can be loose, but should roughly follow
# the format of test name(s), followed by a description of why that
# test is failing, followed by an indication of whose court the
# regression is in.

trivial/mjoyner/seq/seq_index1.chpl

  This seems to have started regressing with one of John's two
  morning 08/25/2005 checkins (jplevyak)

linux valgrind regressions
==========================

trivial/shannon/compSampler

  This is currently failing because compilation takes too long?
