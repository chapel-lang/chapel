bug: default domain maps considered equal for distinct domain types

Since the dawn of time, we've had a single default domain map for
all domain types regardless of whether that domain was rectangular,
associative, sparse, opaque, etc.  It's long seemed to me that
we should instead have a default rectangular domain map and a 
default associative domain map and so forth, but we've never
made that switch.

This design decision shows up in this test because it can't
distinguish between the different domain maps for these distinct
domain types.  If we had distinct default domain maps for each
domain type, we could differentiate and get mismatches across
different domain types.
