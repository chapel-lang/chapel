Change the bounding box of an existing Block distribution to 'newBB'.
'newBB' can be: a domain, a tuple of ranges, or a single range (if 1-D).

If any domain(s) have been dmapped using 'this' distribution,
changeBoundingBox() will halt. If the halt is commented out,
calling changeBoundingBox() will affect only future domains/arrays
created using 'this' - it will not redistribute already-existing
domains/arrays.
