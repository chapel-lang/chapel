bug: dmap(DMobject) duplicates+deallocates DMobject

In this code:

  var bd = new Block(...);
  var dm = new dmap(bd);

* We want dm to wrap bd directly.

* We want bd to remain live afterwards.

Neither is hapenning now. Instead, new dmap(bd):

* clones bd i.e. using .clone() and .dsiClone(), and

* invokes autoDestroy on the original, which decrements
its reference count; Since the ref cnt reaches 0, bd is deleted.
