The robustness tests are contained in the following directories based
on functionality tested:

  basics/      basic domain and array functionality, e.g., iteration
  collapsing/  rank change slicing in which dimensions are collapsed
  composite/   combinations of functionality in other directories
  kernels/     small kernels, e.g., jacobi
  modules/     tests of calling standard module functions on arrays and domains
  reindexing/  reindexing
  resizing/    changing a domain so that the array is resized
  slicing/     slicing
  stress/      stress tests, e.g., creating many distributed arrays in a loop
  trivial/     trivial domain and array functionality, e.g., A.eltType

Each directory should contain a NUMLOCALES file with the value 4 (or
some other appropriate value) and a COMPOPTS file with the line
"-M../" so that the test can use the driver module located in this
directory.


USING AND RUNNING THE SUITE

The top-level file driver.chpl defines an enum type called DistType.
Currently, default, block, cyclic, and blockcylic are supported.
By default, the test suite uses the default (single locale) distribution
when $CHPL_COMM is 'none', and Block distribution otherwise.

To test a new distribution:
* add a new enum constant to DistType
* add the appropriate initialization for your distribution to
  setupDistributions()

To run a test for a particular distribution, say Cyclic,
add these compiler options:

  -sdistType=DistType.cyclic -M$CHPL_HOME/test/distributions/robust/arithmetic

To run tests for Cyclic using start_test or paratest.server, pass:

  -compopts -sdistType=DistType.cyclic
