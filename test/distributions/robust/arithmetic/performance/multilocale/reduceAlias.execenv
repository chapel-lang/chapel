#
# The output of this test is different based on the number of
# sublocales. We currently calculate our number of sublocales using
# the number of Qthreads shepherds. Qthreads automatically picks
# it's number of sublocales based on the number of sockets/other hw
# information unless it is explicitly set so this forces two
# sublocales even on machines that really only have one.
#
# When we change how we set the number of sublocals, this will have
# to be changed as well.
