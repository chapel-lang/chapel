bug: unable to assign between non-distributed and distributed domains

This bug limits the types of operations that can be currently done 
using domains. For instance choosing a subset of an array A[low..hi]
should be independent of the fact that it is distributed or not.
However, this bug points out that such a thing would currently not
be possible.
