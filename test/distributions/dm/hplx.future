bug: concurrent slicing of privatized domains and arrays causes crash

This test crashes intermittently at runtime in the forall loop with -nl4.

The errors I observed in various runs include:
* ReplicatedDist.chpl:272: error: attempt to dereference nil
* ChapelBase.chpl:1022: error: attempt to dereference nil
* Caught a fatal signal: SIGABRT(6) on node 0/4
* *** glibc detected *** hplx_real: corrupted double-linked list: ....
* malloc.c:3091: sYSMALLOc: Assertion `.....' failed.

Uncommenting the commented-out code in the test and/or increasing 'fac'
should increase the probability of failure.

Valgrind detects "Invalid read of size 8", perhaps reliably,
even under -nl2.
In my setup (with fifo) it runs longer than several minutes,
I don't know if it ever terminates.

When this test is fixed, please enable this test for ReplicatedDist
by removing its .skipif:

  test/distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl.chpl
