unimplemented feature: slicing a Dimensional array with a different type of domain

We would like to be able to slice a Dimensional array whose domain
is unstrided with a stridable domain, and visa versa.
This has been disabled to facilitate progress towards the new
array representation.

When this feature is working, uncomment this line:

  test(Ab[1..n by 3, 5..n by 2], (4,5), (7,7));

in s8.chpl and s9.chpl and remove this test altogether.
