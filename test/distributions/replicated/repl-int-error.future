internal error: ReplicatedDist / insertWideReferences / task intents

Something about this code is triggering an internal error in
insertWideReferences seemingly related to task intents.

If I convert the forall loop into a whole-array assignment, the
problem goes away (which probably isn't surprising given the lack of
task-intent support in that context?)
