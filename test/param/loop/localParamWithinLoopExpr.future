bug: param-ness lost in loop expression at local scopes

This test demonstrates that we seem to lose the param-ness of the loop
index variable `j` when it's at a local scope, but not at global
scope.  The two loops demonstrate that it seems to be independent of
whether the local loop expression is parallel or not, which was one
of my suspicions.
