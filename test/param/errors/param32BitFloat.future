bug: We should support 32-bit float params

I believe the only reason these aren't supported today is because we
can neither param-represent 0.0 as a 32-bit float nor param-cast 0.0
to a 32-bit float in the _defaultOf() routines for 32-bit floats.
Other than that, I think our Immediates are set up to handle them
just fine.
