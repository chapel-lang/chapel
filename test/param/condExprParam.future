feature request: conditional expressions should preserve param-ness

This test shows that while I can initialize uints with ints 3 and 5, I
can't initialize them with a conditional expression that returns 3 on
one branch and 5 on another.  This seems frustrating and like it ought
to be fixable.

(Motivation for this: trying to get isx to work with a uint key type
with only a modest number of casts).
