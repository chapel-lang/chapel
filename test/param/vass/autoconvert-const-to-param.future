feature request: convert 'const' to 'param' variables automatically when the initial value is a param

When writing generic code, a const may get initialized with a param
expression for some instantiations and with a non-param expressions
for others. I would like a const to be treated as a param if it is
initialized with a param. The purpose is to enable downstream
optimizations in such a case, for example constant folding, param
function invocation, etc. The example does not show such
optimizations, but I have come across cases where they are desired
in range development.
