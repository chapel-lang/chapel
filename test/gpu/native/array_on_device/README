This directory is for tests that can run with page-locked-memory
(CHPL_CUDA_MEM_STRATEGY=array_data_on_device) at the time we are enabling it.
Down the road, as we have better support for GET/PUT and local data movement,
we expect all tests to pass with that setting, and that setting to be the
default.

These tests are not the only ones that pass, but I didn't want to create full
copy of the suite for now.

Note that the tests have larger kernel launch numbers than their "regular"
siblings. It is because with page-locked memory we have to initialize arrays on
the device (see COMPOPTS), and they cause extra launches.
