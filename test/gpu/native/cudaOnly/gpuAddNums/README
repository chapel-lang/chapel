These test was used in the early days to prototype GPU support.  I think
keeping this test around is a "nice to have" sort of thing because:

- it demonstrates at a very basic level what our runtime library does
- it's good to have as a template to work off of if we end up wanting to add
  support for a new vendor
- it provides test coverage for some important primitives

On the other hand if there's a large maintenance burden involved with this test
keeping this test around it you want to consider just removing it; we've
discussed that here: <https://github.com/Cray/chapel-private/issues/3195>.
