# The -E option we're testing here is the one for the user executable.
# Launchers use this to forward the environment to user executables when
# the underlying system launcher doesn't do that itself.  (An example is
# the GASNet amudprun launcher when used with the ssh spawner.)  The
# launcher itself does not support -E.  It's therefore sufficient, in
# fact necessary, to only test this when no launcher is in use.  Test(s)
# to check that specific launchers properly forward the environment are
# separate.
