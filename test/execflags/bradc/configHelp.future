feature request: user --help overrides built-in

It seems to me that if a user defines a --help config, it should
override the built-in --help that we supply.  This test captures
that idea.

Optionally, the implementer should do this for any other (double-dash)
built-in flags that a user might want to override (and single-dash
if/when we support a means of specifying single-dash aliases for
double-dash arguments).
