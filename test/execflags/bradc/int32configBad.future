feature request: command line config value range check

It would be great if config vars could have their command-line
values range-checked for sanity/safety's sake.  We don't do
this for general assignments due to the performance implications.
In the case of config var command line parsing, we're already
doing string conversion, and this is by nature in non-performant
code, so it would be nice to have some done here.
