All .good files used in this directory are generated by the PREDIFF
script.  Any changes to the "base" -h output (no user config vars)
should be put in basehelp.txt.  Any test specific changes should be
put in <testname>.partgood.

The PREDIFF script collapses all white space into a single space or
new line (i.e., blank lines are ignored), removes all the initial
output describing the non-config command line flags, and also
removes any "configured to" text in the built-in config section.
