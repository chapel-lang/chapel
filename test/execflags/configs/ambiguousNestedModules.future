feature request: support arbitrarily nested module disambiguation

Currently, we support the ability to disambiguate configs using the
config's module name.  But we don't support disambiguation using a
path of module symbols in the event that the ambiguity is in an inner
module.  This is something we ultimately need to be able to do in
order to compose large programs from different authors where the
sources may not be within our control.
