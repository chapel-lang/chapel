This subdirectory contains more or less direct tests of runtime
features, capabilities, performance, etc.  That is, it contains tests
for things like whether chpl_task_getenvNumThreadsPerLocale() returns
the expected value when CHPL_RT_NUM_THREADS_PER_LOCALE='MAX_PHYSICAL',
rather than whether we get some expected number of tasks in a Chapel
forall-stmt that we expect to run over all the physical CPUs.  Tests of
the latter sort can be found elsewhere in the test hierarchy.  Here we
have unit tests that can exonerate or convict the runtime when such
Chapel tests behave in unexpected ways.
