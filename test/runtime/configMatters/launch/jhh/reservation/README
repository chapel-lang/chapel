Tests the slurm-srun launcher when there are slurm reservations included in
the sinfo output. It makes use of Python's unittest framework. Note that the
functionality of hello.chpl doesn't matter, it is invoked with --dry-run so
that it doesn't actually run. The tests look for the proper launcher
arguments in the output. The launcher invokes sbatch and sinfo during
processing, dummy versions of these are in ./bin so that the launcher doesn't
invoke the real versions and instead gets canned output. These tests can
therefore run on a non-slurm system as long as CHPL_LAUNCHER=slurm-srun.
