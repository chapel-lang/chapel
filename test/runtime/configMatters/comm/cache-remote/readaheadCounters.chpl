/*
    This tests the CommDiagnostics counters for following remote cache readahead counters:

    cache_num_page_readaheads: how many cache pages were read ahead
    cache_readahead_unused: how many cache pages that were read ahead were evicted before being accessed once
    cache_readahead_waited: how many cache pages that were read ahead had not arrived by the time we tried to access it.

    A readahead is performed automatically by the remote cache when sequential accesses to remote memory
    is detected. For example, if a GET is performed adjacent to the previous GET, the readahead logic
    will do fetch the rest of the data in the given page.

    Given the nature of this test, it must be executed with at least 2 locales.
