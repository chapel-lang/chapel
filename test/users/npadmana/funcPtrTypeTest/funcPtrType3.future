feature request: c_fn_ptr should contain correct function pointer type.

Currently, c_fn_ptr does not keep track of the actual function pointer type, resulting
in warnings from the backend C compiler about assigning pointers to incompatible types.
Since the test system promotes warnings to errors, this causes tests to fail.

Ideally, this should be fixed by having c_fn_ptr know about the type of the function it 
is wrapping.
