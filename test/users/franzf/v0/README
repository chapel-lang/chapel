This is the original version of SPIRAL-generated C and Chapel that
Franz sent us.  There are a few revisions under source control, based
on some quick feedback we gave him about improving performance.

Inspecting larger problem sizes will show some differences between C
and Chapel in terms of loop nest structure and the types/sizes of
global arrays.  This turned out to be a bug in SPIRAL which they 
have since fixed, resulting in version 1.

Though an apple-to-oranges comparison, here is some timing information
provided by Franz via email:

"The C99 version reaches 5 Gflop/s with the Intel C++ compiler 9.1 and
2.4 Gflop/s with the Cygwin gcc 3.4.4. The Chapel version reaches 30
Mflop/s on a single core of a 2.66 GHz Core2Duo."
