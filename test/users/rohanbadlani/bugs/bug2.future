feature request: The List Module does not support accessing elements of a list based on index. I feel that this should be supported.

Explainations:

		bug8.chpl:8: error: unresolved access of 'list(int(64))' by '(2)'
		
		Bug Description:
			The List Module does not support accessing elements of a list based on index. I feel that this should be supported.
			 

		Explaination:
			I understand the list is implemented as a record, and the above syntax to access the list elements isn't correct, but I as a programmer would want to access elements of the list in some way using indices.
