bug: compiler crashes for a user error in defining a user-defined reduction

This is a trimmed-down version of a test case submitted by Kellen Donohue,
who is a student in Brad's PMP 524 course.

Currently I get (with --develop):

  userDefReduceSlim.chpl:16: error: the type of the actual argument '_unknown' is unknown or generic [callInfo.cpp:35]

This is an INT_FATAL, whereas the compiler should report a user error instead.

While there are probably other futures on this error already, this one
occurs in a peculiar scenario, so I feel it's worth capturing separately.

Note that there are two problems in 'mostFrequent.dom':

* mostFrequent is mentioned without supplying an instantiation for
its 'eltType' generic field, and

* The field access '.dom' is not legal on a type.
(The programmer meant to write partner.dom.)

I am not sure what error message should be generated here,
but anything that hints at either of the above problems would be OK.
