error message: passing strided range to non-strided

The current error message for this is:

test/users/thom/passStridedToNonStrided.chpl:5: error: unresolved call 'foo(range(int,bounded,1))'
test/users/thom/passStridedToNonStrided.chpl:1: note: candidates are: foo(x: range)

which was not clear to Thom and seems like it could be improved:

- the "1" seems like it should be printed out as "true"?
- could the formal range type be expanded to show all of the default
  types/params and make the mismatch more clear?
