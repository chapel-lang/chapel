feature request: writeThis() functions support implicit class-to-string conversions

Thom suggests that in Java, a class with a toString() method can
automatically be converted to a string when necessary and suggests
that supporting the same thing in Chapel would be useful.  I agree
that this seems attractive (as long as we are supporting implicit
conversions to strings; if we switched to explicit conversions to
strings then I'd be inclined to have a string cast on a class invoke
the toString() method.
