feature request: querying a (uniform) varargs type

It seems reasonable to permit the type of a homogeneous
varargs argument list to be queried as we do for other
argument types.

Note that varargs arguments with a specified element
type don't seem to be described (well?) in the spec.
At least I couldn't find it with a quick scan of
examples and the varargs section.

BLC: It seems that when using a query type on a varargs
argument, the type that's produced is the tuple type
of the whole list of arguments rather than the type
of a single element.  This seems syntactically a little
inconsistent w.r.t. the syntax for specifying a varargs
function of a single type as shown in the varArgsInt.chpl
test in this directory.  Perhaps we should use something
like:

        proc bar (x: ?t ...) 

to mean "takes a variable number of arguments of a
consistent type -- call it 't'" and

        proc bar (x... : ?t)

to mean "takes a variable number of arguments -- call
the tuple of types represented by the collection of
arguments 't'.
