error message: Confusing error message.

typenotthis.chpl:8: In function 'do_something':
typenotthis.chpl:10: error: unresolved call 'type R.do_something_helper()'
typenotthis.chpl:4: note: candidates are: R.do_something_helper()

This error message confused me .. for an hour or two.
Not sure exactly how the error message should be improved,
but as far as I know I can't currently write the
equivalent of a 'static' method in C++ or Java -
so R.method() is always an error, is it not?

If R.method() isn't always an error, perhaps the error
message could indicate more strongly that the 'type' part
that the issue is that I'm trying to call an instance
method on a type and not an instance? Something like:

typenotthis.chpl:8: In function 'do_something':
typenotthis.chpl:10: error: unresolved call 'type R.do_something_helper()'
typenotthis.chpl:10: note: method called on type not instance
typenotthis.chpl:4: note: candidates are: R.do_something_helper()
typenotthis.chpl:4: note: candidates require instance not type
