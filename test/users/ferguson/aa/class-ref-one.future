error message: superclass type by reference

Passing a superclass type by reference to a function

Currently this test fails with an internal error upon --verify,
or fails during C compilation without --verify.
When this .future is retired, --verify can/should be removed from .compopts.

Earlier notes:

If C and CC are classes, and CC : C, I expect
to be able to pass var cc:CC to an argument position
expecting type C, but I get errors like:

class-ref-one.c: In function 'doit':
class-ref-one.c:212: error: passing argument 3 of 'foo' from incompatible pointer type
class-ref-one.c:92: note: expected '_ref_C' but argument is of type 'CC'

This should be a more reasonable Chapel-level error,
but the program is incorrect.
