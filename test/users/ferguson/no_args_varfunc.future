feature request: allow zero actual arguments for a vararg, i.e. a variable-number-of-arguments formal

The spec seems to indicate that variable argument functions
can have any number of arguments, but they cannot have zero
arguments.

I would like them to allow zero arguments, partly so that
writeln() works without needing an overload.
