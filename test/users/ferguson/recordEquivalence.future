unimplemented feature: Implicit casting of record parameters is not implemented.

According to the spec, an argument of compatible type (i.e. that can be assigned
to the target type) passed to a function expecting a record type should be
implictly cast to the target type, and the assignment performed to initialize
the formal argument.

This behavior is not currently implementation.

Workaround: Use an explicit cast on the actual parameter.
Priority: 2
