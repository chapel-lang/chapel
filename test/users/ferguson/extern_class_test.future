bug: does not compile due to nil/NULL external class references

When QIO was introduced, the original failure mode of this test was
masked by another one.  The ChapeIO.chpl module can't currently handle
NULL/nil extern class references because they are not recognized as
isClassType() (for better or worse) and then a method is called on
them.  I mailed Michael Ferguson yesterday to alert him to this.  A
possible fix would be to support an isExtern() or isExternClass()
function via a primitive to handle this case (either within or after
the current class case).

Here's the original report for reference, should it reoccur once this
part of the bug is cleared up:

bug: does not compile on multilocale due to argument type mismatch



I get:
$ chpl extern_class_test.chpl extern_class_test.h
In file included from /tmp/chpl-mppf-22338.deleteme/_main.c:25:0:

cc1: all warnings being treated as errors

gmake: *** [all] Error 1

works fine on single locale.
