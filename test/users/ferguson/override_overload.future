bug: compiler segfault override/overload

Non-deterministic compiler seg faults when compiling this program.

9/11/14 (sungeun): This doesn't seg fault all the time.  The seg fault
is in add_internal() of the Vec class called from
compute_call_sites(), but I've seen it happen during inlineFunctions
as well as removeUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls.
