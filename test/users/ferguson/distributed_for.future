semantic: should for over a distributed array run loop body on owners?

It seems to me that since 'on' is serial, a serial for
loop over distributed data should run the loop body
wherever the data is stored.

Right now you get that with forall, but that also
implies parallelism, and parallelism and locality
are supposed to be orthogonal....
