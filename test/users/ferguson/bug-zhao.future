bug: module init fn takes has _endCount formal

This seems to be a strange interaction between modules and adding
end counts.

It seems that the compiler-generated function containing the
default-module code, chpl__init_bug, has an extra argument for _endCount.
This argument is not present if these last
10 lines are removed.

Interestingly, if these last 10 lines are put in their own file, it
compiles.

The _endCount argument is added in parallel.cpp.
