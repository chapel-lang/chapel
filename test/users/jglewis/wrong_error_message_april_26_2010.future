bug: cast to non-type is not flagged as an error

The cast on lines 18-20 is casting to the void value, not type.  It currently
compiles and runs, but should be an error.

This is the same basic problem as shown by the tests:
  expressions/vass/cast-to-non-type-1.future
  expressions/vass/cast-to-non-type-2.future
