feature request: unbounded formal array reindexing

allow reindexing a formal array argument upon call to a
procedure.  This simplifies coding matrix computations for situations where the
index ranges for the formal argument differ across dimensions, but where notions
like "diagonal" apply in the operation being performed on the array.

Reindexing allows a programmer to make the assumption that index ranges on a
square matrix are identical even when they are not in the formal argument.  That
assumption is fundamental to many existing Fortran and C codes.
