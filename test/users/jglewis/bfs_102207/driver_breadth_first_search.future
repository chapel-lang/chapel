unimplemented feature: arrays of sparse domains

sjd: dense works

Arrays of subdomains (sparse or dense) don't seem to be working.


John's notes:

domain Nbr_List in breadth_first_search.chpl can be logically be either a sparse
subdomain or an associative domain.  The associative domain version executes,
producing the "bfs.out.good" file.  The sparse subdomain version segfaults in
the initialization phase of this procedure, before the diagnostic print
statement at the beginning of the main loop.

The two declarations are either

     type Nbr_List = sparse subdomain ( Node_Set );  // fails

or 

     type Nbr_List = domain (int); // succeeds
