bug: cyclic striding

From John Lewis' commit message:

A small test case in which the use of an alias to a STRIDED cyclically
distributed array causes incorrect memory references.  This may be a known
problem -- striding in cyclic distributions is stated not to be fully
supported.  If it is a known problem, someone should just remove this test.
Fixing it is NOT a high priority!
