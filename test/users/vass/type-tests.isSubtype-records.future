feature request: record inheritance

We removed support for record inheritance after realizing that we hadn't
sufficiently solidified its details.  This test will probably be useful when we
rethink the feature (see Github issue #6851)

Note that this test was split out from type-tests.isSubtype.chpl.  If/when
record inheritance becomes supported, revert the commit in which this happened.
