feature request: enable + / divceil(n,m) on more combinations of integral types

divceil() instantiated for the four type combinations listed in .chpl
hit typechecking issues because of the type restrictions on + and /.
The same applies to divfloor().

Most interestingly, + and (probably) / and others need to be defined
on (uint(32),uint(64)) and (uint(64),uint(32)), which is real straightforward.

After these have been enabled, please uncomment
the corresponding lines in verify-ceil-floor-mod-1.chpl.
