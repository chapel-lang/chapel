bug: compiler crashes with an assertion: Cannot call insertAfter on Expr not in a list [expr.cpp:146]

It trips over something in missing_plus() in the normalize pass.
(This currently happens even if missing_plus() is not invoked from anywhere.)

NOTE: What is missing_plus()?  It's not the test program or any of the Chapel source files.
