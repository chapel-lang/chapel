bug: better error message for extern procs declared to take an array who return
     the Chapel void type.

The function voidArrayFunction returns void (on the C end), and a user would be
inclined to declare (on the Chapel end) the extern proc to return Chapel void
(literally 'void'), when nothing should be specified.

While the error message is correct, it does not make it clear that the issue is
on the users end, and gives the appearance that the compiler is at fault.

message:
void_extern_proc_array.chpl:3: error: illegal use of function that does not
return a value: 'chpl__extern_array_voidArrayFunction'
