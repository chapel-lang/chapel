semantic: should we be able to infer that a function is returning
types?

Put another way, why should the user be forced to specify the 'type'
keyword in this function?

Note that this test is a clone of raiseType-blc.chpl which I checked
in unfuturized because I think it's a nice test of the language as it
stands.
