error message: prune candidate function list

Better yet, issue a direct message saying "cannot compare types with values"

was:

bug: comparing types to values permitted

While we've tightened up our ability to intermix types and values,
this seems like a case that's still slipping through.  I think the
comparison of the value x to the types bool/int should result in an
error.
