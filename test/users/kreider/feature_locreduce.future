feature request: minloc/maxloc reduction over array without zipper

A minloc reduction currently requires zipping the array with its domain, ie.
   minloc reduce zip(A, A.domain)
instead of just
   minloc reduce A
which would return a tuple with the value and the index/indices at the minimum.

This request is in addition to using a zipper, which has its own uses.
