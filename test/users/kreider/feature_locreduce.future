feature request: minloc/maxloc reduction over array without zipper

A minloc reduction currently requires zipping the array with its domain, ie.
   minloc reduce zip(A, A.domain)
instead of just
   minloc reduce A
which would return a tuple with the value and the index/indices at the minimum.

This request is in addition to using a zipper, which has its own uses.


Brad notes: Given the current interface, this is not possible, because
user-defined reductions do not take the array in as a whole, but rather
are fed the array's elements one element at a time by the reduction
machinery.  Given an array element (e.g., the int '42' from an array of
integers) it's not possible to determine its index as the context has
already been lost.  Thus, to support this feature would require a
reasonably drastic rewrite of how reductions are implemented.
