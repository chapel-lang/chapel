bug: Chapel ignores unused code when compiling.

The compiler ignores code that isn't in use.  This means that there can be
latent errors that go undetected.  You could argue that there should always
be a test case to exercise the code, in which case the errors would be found.
But it is handy to run checks stand-alone (to catch typos or syntax errors,
for example).  There is also no warning about what code has been ignored, 
which might be another approach.
