feature request: beef up recursive type inference

The example here (based on a test program submitted by Lucas
M. Shimizu on Aug 3rd) shows that we do much better with recursive
functions whose return types are declared than those for which it's
not.  

It seems to me that with a modest amount of work, we could infer the
return type of any non-recursive code paths in the traditional way and
then verify that plugging that type in for the recursive case doesn't
break anything to improve this situation.  Maybe I'm overlooking
something, so I made this a feature request rather than a bug.
