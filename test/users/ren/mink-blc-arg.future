feature request: arguments to user-defined reductions

In our early plans for user-defined reductions, we'd talked about
supporting the ability to pass arguments to the implementing class'
initializer.  This test captures that concept.  I think the concept is
important -- the syntax proposed here seems intuitive but is not
crucial.  Note that there's a bit of a similarity here with our desire
to turn reductions into more of a value type and/or removing the
explicit call to new and making it look like a class initializer call
to the user.
