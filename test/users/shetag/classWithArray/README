classWithArray-orig.chpl  : the original code from email, not tested
classWithArray.chpl       : a modified version with interesting output and
                            a few more test cases that work

classWithArray-init.chpl  : a version that initializes the class' array with
                            an external variable; doesn't support 0-argument
                            constructor call
classWithArray-init-works.chpl : a version of the above with the 0-argument
                                 constructor commented out; could be removed
                                 once the above works.

classWithArray-init2.chpl : similar to the classWithArray-init.chpl, but
                            eliminating the array variable outside of the
                            class

classWithArray-init3.chpl : similar to the above but uses scalar initializer
