bug: Compiler-generated constructors are surprisingly non-generic for array fields

With the change from closed-form representation of arrays to array
views, this test no longer works due to the fact that the
compiler-generated constructor requires the actual to be a default
rectangular.  As tensor-workaround.chpl and the codes in the issue
show, this isn't the case with user-defined constructors as well.

Once the compiler-generated initializer is similarly generic, this
test should work again.  Once it does, we should remove the
tensor-workaround.chpl variation of it.  We should also be able to
remove a similar manually-introduced constructor for CandidateDomain
in test/studies/amr/lib/amr/BergerRigoutsosClustering.chpl.
