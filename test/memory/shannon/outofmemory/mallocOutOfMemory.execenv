# This test dials back the amount of virtual memory allowed to make sure that
# we get sane error messages when we run out of memory. The limit is fairly low
# which can be a problem for qthreads. Qthreads bulk allocates memory for a
# couple hundred threads on initialization. For qthreads default stack size
# that's not a problem, but if you bump the stack size up to 8MB or something
# that quickly turns into multiple GBs, which exceeds the ulimit that gets set.
# This just dials back the default stack size to avoid this.
