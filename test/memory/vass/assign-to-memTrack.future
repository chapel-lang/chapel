feature request: make 'memTrack' assignable to from Chapel code

Since I can write memoryUsed() in Chapel, I should also be able
to write in Chapel whatever is needed to make that call succeed.

Presently that seems to be 'memTrack=true', but I am not allowed
to do that, as 'memTrack' is declared a const (ChapelLocale.chpl).

We should change that (or provide other means or enabling
memoryUsed() from within Chapel). E.g. startTrackingMemory()
would mean start counting from that point. This includes finding
ways to start tracking in the middle of program execution.
