bug: memTracking deadlocks for tests that can't task yield

memory tracking currently uses a sync var as a lock. sync vars can yield the
current ask and for programs that are relying on their tasks not yielding this
can lead to deadlock. mem tracking really shouldn't be using sync vars then,
and perhaps should using a pthread_mutex intead (although then we have to be
careful that we lock/unlock with the same pthread.)

When this future is retired, please remove the skipif
