semantic: should the type of an iterable expression be consistent?

Today, if you save an iterable expression into a local variable, it will get
turned into an array.  However, if you use an iterable expression as an actual
to a function, its type will be an iterator and will be treated as such in the
function body.  Should these types be unified, and if so, what should the
type be?
