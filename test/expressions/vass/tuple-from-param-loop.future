feature request: 'for' expression with a param index variable to create a tuple

Also:

* Allow tuples to be params, when each component is a param.

* Allow a param 'for' expression to have a filtering predicate,
just like a regular 'for' expression. The predicate must be
a param. It filters out tuple components, just like in
regular 'for' expressions.

Motivation: really need this for rank-independent code,
when mapping one expression to another expression for each dimension
and the result type [of this mapping] is hard to write out in advance.
