feature request: combined div&mod operator

Operator: /%
Semantics: a /% b is the tuple (a/b, a%b).
Defined for the types of a and b for which a/b and a%b are defined.

Motivation 1: make Chapel cooler.

Motivation 2: faster than doing the two operations independently,
when both division and modulus are needed.

("Faster" requires, of course, that the hardware supports it and
the C compiler can take advantage of it on the given platform.
Or, if div and mod are implemented as library calls, that there
be a div&mod library call. But Motivation 1 still remains there. :)
