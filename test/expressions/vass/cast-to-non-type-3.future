error message: issue the error for "illegal cast to non-type" only once

Currently the compiler will issue such an error twice
for a cast to a non-type such that a cast to the corresponding type
would not have succeeded.

So maybe in this case it should also say that the cast would be
illegal if it were to the corresponding type.
