Publish a package to the mason-registry repository

Usage:
    mason publish [options] <registry>

Options:
    -h, --help                   Display this message
    --dry-run                    Check to see if package is ready to be published
    <registry>                   Positional argument indicates publishing to a personal registry

Publishing requires the mason-registry to be forked and the package to have a remote origin.
