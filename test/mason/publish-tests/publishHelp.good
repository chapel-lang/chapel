Publish a package to the mason-registry repository

Usage:
    mason publish [options] <registry>

Options:
    <registry>                   Positional argument indicates the target registry. Defaults to chapel-lang/mason-registry
    -h, --help                   Display this message
    --dry-run                    Check to see if package is ready to be published
    --no-update                  Prevents registries from being updated when a package is published.
    --check                      Runs check to see if package can be published successfully to <registry>

Publishing requires the mason-registry to be forked and the package to have a remote origin.
