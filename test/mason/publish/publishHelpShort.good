Publish a package to the mason-registry repository

Usage:
    mason publish [options] <registry>

Options:
    <registry>                   Positional argument indicates the target registry. Defaults to chapel-lang/mason-registry
    -h, --help                   Display this message
    -c, --create-registry        Creates a local registry at path
    --dry-run                    Check to see if package is ready to be published
    --check                      Runs check to see if package can be published successfully to <registry>
    --ci-check                   Same as --check, except omits git origin checks
    --[no-]update                [Do not] Prevent registries from being updated when a package is published.

Publishing requires the mason-registry to be forked and the package to have a remote origin.
