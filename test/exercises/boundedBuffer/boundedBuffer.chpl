// default number of producers and consumers above to avoid having to
// set them on every run (I had good results with 5 of each).
//
// STEP 2: Modify task 1 of the cobegin below to create 'numProducers'
// producers numbered 1..numProducers.  Similarly, modify task 2 so
// that it creates 'numConsumers' consumers numbered 1..numConsumers.
// While you can compile and run at this point (and should), note that
// the program is probably not correct (see STEP 3 below).

//
// STEP 3: The head and tail member variables below are currently
// unsynchronized, meaning that when multiple producers and consumers
// are running, their reads and writes to them may race.  The
// problematic statement is the following one from 'advance()':
//
//     pos = (pos + 1) % capacity;
//
// Specifically, if two tasks are executing this statement
// simultaneously, their operations may interleave as follows:
// Task A reads pos -- let's say that it has the value '21'
// Task B reads pos, which is still '21'
// Task A computes the new value of pos as '22' and writes it
// Task B also computes the value of '22' and writes it
// each task returns '21'
//
// This is a race because it means that both tasks will have obtained
// the same position rather than each getting a unique position.
//
// While the chances of this race are extremely slim (and slimmer in
// --verbose=true mode because of the time required for all of the
// printing), if this were your bank account or airline reservation,
// you wouldn't want to take the risk of not hitting it.
//
// A conventional approach might be to put some sort of mutual
// exclusion around the noted statement so that only one task could
// execute it at a time, but in Chapel, we prefer data-centric
// coordination between tasks.  To that end, guard against this race
// by changing head and tail to 'sync' variables.  Note that in
// addition to changing their definitions, you'll need to change the
// advance() helper function below.
//
// STEP 4: Now try doing step 3 again by making head and tail 'atomic'
// variables (save a copy of your 'sync' version in case you want to
// return to it later).
//
// Hints for the atomic-based solution:
//
// (1) atomic variables can't currently be initialized at their
// declaration point (something we're working on fixing in the
// language), but since they are integers, their initial values
// will be zero, so you probably will not need to initialize them.
// If you do, add an initializer to 'BoundedBuffer' of the form:
//
//   proc init() {
//     ... put your code to initialize the atomics here ...
//   }
//
// (2) read(), write() and compareAndSwap() are going to be the most
// useful methods on atomics for this exercise.  If you haven't worked
// with atomics before, refer to the online documentation or ask one
// of the helpers for a hint:
//
//   https://chapel-lang.org/docs/builtins/internal/Atomics.html
//
// STEP 5 (optional): Compare the performance of your two versions
// (note: you may want to turn off the --noisy and/or --verbose
// configs when doing timings, and as always for performance runs, be
// sure to compile with the --fast flag).
//
// STEP 6 (optional): What would it take to make this bounded buffer
// code a distributed memory program?
//
// STEP 7 (optional and macho): What would it take to make this
// bounded buffer code into a *scalable* distributed memory program?
//


//
// This is a generic bounded buffer class
//
class BoundedBuffer {
  type eltType = real;    // it can store scalar types; the default is 'real'

  const capacity: int,                     // the capacity of the buffer
        sentinel: eltType = -1.0;          // the sentinel value

  var buff$: [0..#capacity] sync eltType,  // the sync values, empty by default

  // Place an item at the head position of the buffer, assuming
  // it's available (empty).  If not, the write to 'buff$[head]' will
  // block until it is.  Then advance the 'head' position.

    if noisy then sleep(rng.getNext() / prodNoiseScale);

  // per consumer and only once all producers are done.

    produce(sentinel);
  }

  //
  // Consume() an item from the tail position of the buffer, assuming
  // it's available (full).  If not, the read from 'buff$[tail]' will
  // block until it is.  Then advance the 'tail' position.  Return a
  // tuple containing (1) the data value read and (2) 'true' if there
  // is more data to be read (the sentinel value has not been found),
  // 'false' otherwise.
  //
  proc consume(): (eltType, bool) {
    if noisy then sleep(rng.getNext() / consNoiseScale);

    const val = buff$[advance(tail)].readFE();
