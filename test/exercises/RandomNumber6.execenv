# This test creates 10,000 tasks and immediately puts them to sleep.
# With qthreads and the current default stack size of 8MB that means
# you could have ~78 GB allocated for the tasks' stacks, which is
# way too much. Dialing back the stack size for this test since all
# of the tasks are small. Note that this is not an issue for fifo
# since not every task has it's own stack.
