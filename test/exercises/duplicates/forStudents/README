Data Processing Hands-On Exercise: Finding Duplicate Files
==========================================================

This directory contains the framework for writing a Chapel program to find
duplicate files.

What is in this directory?
**************************

FileHashing.chpl:
  This module defines:
  * a type SHA256Hash supporting the usual comparison and assignment operators
    as well as writeln
  * a function computeFileHash that returns a hash for a file
  * a function relativeRealPath used to normalize paths

duplicates.chpl:
  This is the code you'll edit for this exercise.

example-files/
  This directory stores some example files for testing your program.

expected-output:
  This file contains the expected output for your program when run on the
  example-files directory.

Hands-On Tasks
**************

Step 0: Getting Started
-----------------------

To get started with this project, compile 'duplicates.chpl':

  chpl duplicates.chpl

Then, try running it with the example-files directory:

  ./duplicates example-files

It should (incorrectly) report that all the files are duplicates.

Feel free to look over the provided source code in duplicates.chpl
and in the provided modules FileHashing.chpl and
SHA256Implementation.chpl.

Step 1: Compute Hashes to Detect Duplicates
-------------------------------------------

Your next task is to get it reporting only actual duplicates. To do so,
you'll need to adjust the program to compute the hashes of the files.
Edit `computeHashes` near the top of the program. This function should
compute the hash for each path and store it in the hashAndPath array.
You'll want to call the provided function `computeFileHash` from the
FileHashing module to compute the file hashes.

The Tuples and Arrays primers might be useful resources for this step:

  https://chapel-lang.org/docs/main/primers/tuples.html
  https://chapel-lang.org/docs/primers/arrays.html

Run your program on the example-files directory and compare the output
with the contents of the file expected-output. Additionally, your
system might support one (or both) of these commands:

 sha256sum <file-to-hash>
 openssl sha256 <file-to-hash>

If so, you can check that your program is computing the correct SHA256
hashes for a particular file by comparing hashes with the results from the
above commands.

Step 2: Compute Hashes in Parallel
----------------------------------

Adjust your implementation of `computeHashes` to compute file hashes
in parallel. Does it still give correct output?

To understand how this affects the performance of this program, add a timer to
this function, using the Time module.

  https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/Time.html

Then, test the performance of your parallel version by running it to
find duplicate .chpl files in Chapel's test suite.

  ./duplicates --filter=".chpl" <path-to-chapel-tests>

Is it faster to compute the SHA256 sums in multiple tasks?
Make sure to compile with --fast when doing performance comparisons!

Step 3: Add Error Handling
--------------------------

We'd like our duplicate file detector to fail gracefully if it finds a
file it cannot open. For example, if it runs accross a file it can't read,
it will print an error like this:

uncaught TaskErrors: 1 errors: PermissionError: Permission denied (in open with path "<some path>")
  duplicates.chpl:30: thrown here
  duplicates.chpl:30: uncaught here

Instead of halting when such errors are encountered, make it instead
log the errors. For the purposes of this exercise, let's assume that
writing a message to stdout using `writeln` is sufficient.

The first step is create a test directory in which you can see
the above error. You can use the following commands to do so:

  echo No Reading > example-files/noread
  chmod a-r example-files/noread
  # you can remove this file if you need to, with
  #   rm example-files/noread

Run your program on the example-files directory after adding this
file. Your program should halt before printing any duplicates.

Use error handling constructs to:
 * output a message (we are imagining to a log file but for this exercise
   just use writeln)
 * continue processing the other files

To learn more about error handling in Chapel, see the Error Handling
primer:

 https://chapel-lang.org/docs/primers/errorHandling.html


Bonus Task B1: Create a Program Generating Each Byte
----------------------------------------------------

We used the file example-files/all-bytes1 in testing our file
duplication detector. This file contains each byte once, and in order.
To inspect this file, use xxd:

  xxd example-files/all-bytes1

This task is to create a Chapel program that can produce this file.
You'll want to look at the I/O primer and module documentation:

  https://chapel-lang.org/docs/primers/fileIO.html
  https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/IO.html

Here are some hints of specific features you might use:
 * `open`
 * `file.writer` with `kind=iokind.native`
 * the `%|1u` format string

Bonus Task B2: Use Records Instead of Tuples
--------------------------------------------

The program we have been working with so far used an array of tuples.
But such programs might be harder to maintain since one might forget
which tuple component is the hash and which is the file path.

So, in this task, you'll modify your program to use an array of records
instead of an array of tuples.

The records primer is a good starting point for learning more about records:

  https://chapel-lang.org/docs/main/primers/records.html

Note that you'll need to change the sort call. Records don't currently
get comparison operators by default. While that might change in the
future, this is a good opportunity to learn about how to sort with a
custom comparator. See

 https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/packages/Sort.html

Bonus Task B3: Sort Output by File Size
---------------------------------------

Our file duplication program is now in production and we're getting user
feedback! Our users are clamoring for the ability to sort the output by
file size, because they'd like to investigate the large duplicates first.

The task here is to modify your program to do so. Additionally you
can make it print out the size of the file hashed.

To find the library function to get the size of a file from a path,
head over to the FileSystem documentation here:

 https://chapel-lang.org/docs/modules/standard/FileSystem.html
