─── error in tupleDecls.chpl:1 [TupleDeclNotTuple] ───
  Value of non-tuple type 'unknown type' cannot be split using a tuple declaration.
  In the following tuple declaration:
      |
    1 | var (x,y) = notKnown;
      |
  the initialization expression has type 'unknown type', while it is expected to be a 2-tuple.

─── error in tupleDecls.chpl:3 [TupleDeclNotTuple] ───
  Value of non-tuple type 'int(64)' cannot be split using a tuple declaration.
  In the following tuple declaration:
      |
    3 | var (u,v) = z;
      |
  the initialization expression has type 'int(64)', while it is expected to be a 2-tuple.

─── error in tupleDecls.chpl:4 [TupleDeclMismatchedElems] ───
  Tuple size mismatch in split tuple declaration.
      |
    4 | var (a,b,c) = (1,2);
      |
  The left-hand side of the declaration expects a 3-tuple, but the right-hand side is a 2-tuple, '(int(64), int(64))'.
