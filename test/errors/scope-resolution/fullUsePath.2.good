─── warning in fullUsePath.chpl:1 [ImplicitFileModule] ───
  An implicit module named 'fullUsePath' is being introduced to contain file-scope code.
  The following is the first file-scope statement:
      |
    1 | param ToLookFor = "??";
      |
  The implicit module 'fullUsePath' is being created because the above code is outside of any module declarations (e.g., 'module M1').
  Note that all of the file's contents -- including module 'M1' -- will be placed into the new 'fullUsePath' module.

─── error in fullUsePath.chpl:9 [UseImportUnknownMod] ───
  Cannot find module or enum named 'ToLookFor'.
  In the following 'use' statement:
      |
    9 |                 use ToLookFor;
      |                     ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  The following declarations are not covered by the 'use' statement but seem similar to what you meant.
  
  A declaration of 'ToLookFor' is here:
      |
    1 | param ToLookFor = "??";
      |       ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  However, 'use' statements can only be used with modules or enums (and this 'ToLookFor' is not a module or enum).
