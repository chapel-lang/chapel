  Cannot find module named 'ToLookFor'.
  In the following 'import' statement:
      |
    9 |                 import ToLookFor;
      |                        ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  The following declarations are not covered by the 'import' statement but seem similar to what you meant.
  
  A module named 'ToLookFor' is defined here:
      |
    3 |     module ToLookFor {}
      |     ⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺
      |
  However, a full path or an explicit relative import is required for modules that are not at the root level.
  
  For non-root-level modules, please specify the full path to the module or use a relative import e.g. 'import this.M' or 'import super.M'
