─── warning in implicitSubModule.chpl:4 [ImplicitFileModule] ───
  An implicit module named 'implicitSubModule' is being introduced to contain file-scope code.
  The following is the first file-scope statement:
      |
    4 | use List;
      |
  The implicit module 'implicitSubModule' is being created because the above code is outside of any module declarations (e.g., 'module M').
  Note that all of the file's contents -- including module 'M' -- will be placed into the new 'implicitSubModule' module.
