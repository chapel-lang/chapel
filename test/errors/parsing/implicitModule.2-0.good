─── warning in implicitModule.chpl:4 [ImplicitFileModule] ───
  An implicit module named 'implicitModule' is being introduced to contain file-scope code.
  The following is the first file-scope statement:
      |
    4 | var x = 1;
      |
  The implicit module 'implicitModule' is being created because the above code is outside of any module declarations (e.g., 'module TheModule').
  Note that all of the file's contents -- including module 'TheModule' -- will be placed into the new 'implicitModule' module.
