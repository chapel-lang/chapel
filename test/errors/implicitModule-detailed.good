─── warning in implicitModule.chpl:4 [ImplicitFileModule] ───
  An implicit module named 'implicitModule' is being introduced to contain this file-scope code.
  The following is the first file-scope statement:
      |
    4 | var x = 1;
      |
  The implicit module 'implicitModule' is being created because the above code is outside of any module declarations (e.g., 'module TheModule').
  Note that all of the file's contents will be placed into the new 'implicitModule' module.
