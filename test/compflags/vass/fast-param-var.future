feature request: fastCompilation param and --no-fast compiler option

When developing code, I'd like to include checks that are disabled
when compiling with --fast and enabled otherwise.
Right now I am keying off of boundsChecking, but that's not exactly the same.
So I suggest to provide a param, say "fastCompilation", that the compiler
will set to true upon --fast and to false otherwise.

While we are at it, would be nice to provide --no-fast, for symmetry.
Allthough we need to discuss what that would mean.
The simplest is "don't do any of those things you'd do upon --fast".
But currently in the compiler options are positional,
e.g. -g --no-line-numbers and --no-line-numbers -g have different meaning,
so --fast .... --no-fast may not be the same as --no-fast ....
I'll leave this as a T.B.D. for now.
