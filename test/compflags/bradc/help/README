Whenever the output of --help changes from the user's
perspective, the userhelp.good file must be updated to
reflect the new contents of the help message.

Why do we have this test?  (1) because we care about
how help looks to the user, and (2) because the test
forces us to think about how and where the new flag
should go rather than just throwing it in and making
a mess as we did earlier.
