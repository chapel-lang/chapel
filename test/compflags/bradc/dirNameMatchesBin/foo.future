bug: confusion when -o name matches directory name

The compiler isn't very helpful when the name given to the -o flag
matches a pre-existing directory name.  In particular, it creates a
binary in foo/ named foo.tmp which would be reasonably surprising to
an end-user.  I'm proposing that we generate an error message similar
to gcc, which reports:

  ld: cannot open output file foo: Is a directory
