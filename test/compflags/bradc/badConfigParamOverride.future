bug: mixing illegal types in config param setting

This test should generate an error since j is an int but we're trying
to initialize it to a floating point value.  Instead of some sort of
type mismatch error, though, it generates an error complaining that
the initializer is not a compile-time value:

chpl -sj=5.1 ./badConfigParamOverride.chpl
./badConfigParamOverride.chpl:1: error: Initializing parameter 'j' to value not known at compile time [functionResolution.cpp:3482]
