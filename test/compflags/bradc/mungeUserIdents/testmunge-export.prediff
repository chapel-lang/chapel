# This test ensures that the generated code contains instances of foo,
# bar, and baz (variables that the test does not expect to see munged)
# and does not contain instances of foo_chpl, bar_chpl, and baz_chpl
# (which would imply that they have been munged).  The test also
# verifies that other variables have been renamed, by using reserved
# and unprotected names, like socket and connect which will conflict
# with standard library identifiers if not renamed.
