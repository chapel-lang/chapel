feature request: allow assumed domain array return types
#8468

Remove the skipif on these tests when they pass - the
important part is the error in the precomp, which causes
the linking failure logged as our output.  The linker
output varies depending on platform and compiler, and
isn't the core of the issue so is not worth tracking
each variation on the failure output.
