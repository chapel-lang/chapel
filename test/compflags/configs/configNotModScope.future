bug: configs permitted at module sub-scopes

The language spec says that configs are only permitted at module
scope, which is what I think we want to support, yet this test shows
that we also permit them within local scopes at module scope.  But I
don't think this is intended, I think it's just a mistake in the
implementation of the check that exists for configs that are local to
procedures (say).
