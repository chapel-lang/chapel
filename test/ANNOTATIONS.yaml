# The format for this file is as follows:
#
# all:
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - example annotation text 1 (#PR)
#
# group:
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - example annotation text 2 (#PR)
#     - example annotation text 3 (#PR)
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - text: example annotation text 4 (#PR)
#       config: [config1, config2]
#
#
# where 'group' is the base name of the .graph file that attached set
# of annotations should apply to.  'all' is a special group where any
# annotations are added to to every single graph.
#
# When the long form of an annotation is used (where 'text:' and
# 'config:' are specified), the annotation is only added to the graphs
# if the current configuration is in the configuration list. Note
# that in this form, the 'config:' line does not (cannot) have a
# leading '-' sign.
#
# The date listed should be day the impact of a change is seen, not
# the day of the commit. e.g. if a commit was made on 11/11/11, the
# date listed should be 11/12/11 (assuming testing ran successfully
# that night, otherwise use the first day when testing runs again.)
#
# Groups are listed in case insensitive alphabetical order
