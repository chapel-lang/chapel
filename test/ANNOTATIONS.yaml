# The format for this file is as follows:
#
# group:
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - example annotation 1
#     - example annotation 2
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - text: example annotation 3
#       host: [hostname1, hostname2]
#
# all:
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - example annotation 5
#
# where group is the name of the .graph file that attached set of annotations
# should apply to. When the long form of an annotation is used (when text and
# host are specified) the annotation is only added to the graphs if the current
# hostname is in the host list. 'all' is a special group where any annotations
# are added to to every single graph. One limitation of dygraphs is that if you
# try and place an annotation on a date that has no data (tests didn't run or
# all failed) it will not be displayed.
