# The format for this file is as follows:
#
# all:
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - example annotation 1
#
# group:
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - example annotation 2
#     - example annotation 3
#   mm/dd/yy:
#     - text: example annotation 4
#       host: [hostname1, hostname2]
#
#
# where 'group' is the base name of the .graph file that attached set
# of annotations should apply to.  'all' is a special group where any
# annotations are added to to every single graph.
#
# When the long form of an annotation is used (where 'text:' and
# 'host:' are specified), the annotation is only added to the graphs
# if the current hostname is in the host list.  Note that in this
# form, the 'host:' line does not (cannot) have a leading '-' sign.
#
# Groups are listed in case insensitive alphabetical order
#
