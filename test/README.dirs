%% Test directory hierarchy (DRAFT)
%%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%% Keeping the spec chapters at the top level seems to make the root node too
%% fat, so I propose categorizing these according to the main language function
%% addressed by that chapter or test section.  Spec sections are shown
%% capitalized and without a trailing slash.  Existing test directories have
%% also been folded in and are marked with a trailing slash.  If the existing
%% directory seems to map to a spec section, they are shown on the same line,
%% separated by a comma.  New directories being proposed by me are prefixed by a
%% star. <hilde>

%% Open Issues:
%%  Should tests corresponding to spec chapters be merged with standalone tests?
%%  Are there other directories whose contents should be distributed?
%%  What's the target number of subdirectories or tests in each directory?
