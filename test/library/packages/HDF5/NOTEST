These tests are supposed to be skipped if the HDF5 library is not available,
but on some of our test systems the .skipif file reports that it is available
even though the module that would make it available is not loaded.

After loading that module, I found that there are differences between it and
the version I had been using from homebrew.  This file will silence these
tests until I'm able to investigate the differences further.
