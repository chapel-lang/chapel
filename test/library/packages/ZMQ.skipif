 The ZMQ package requires the zmq library.

 Installation of the ZMQ library is detected with the find_library function,
 which looks for the appropriate dynamic library (e.g. libzmq.so).
 Note that if the dynamic library is found, this test assumes that the
 header and static library are available.

 Skip CHPL_COMM != none until #9425 is resolved.
