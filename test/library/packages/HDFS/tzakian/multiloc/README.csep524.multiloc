Use this guide to rebuild your copy of the CSEP524 Chapel distribution
to support multiple locales and build Chapel
programs to use multiple locales.


1. Make sure $CHPL_HOME is set, as usual

2. Set Chapel communication to GASNet (a network library for PGAS languages)

export CHPL_COMM=gasnet

3. Reconfigure Chapel

./rebuild-multilocale.sh


4. Compiling and running Chapel programs

If CHPL_COMM is set to gasnet then chpl will now
build Chapel programs for multiple locales.

Unset CHPL_COMM if you want to build Chapel programs
normally. 
e.g., export CHPL_COMM=


Set variables to run Chapel multilocale on single machine (e.g., your VM):
source setenv.multiloc-local.bash

Set variables to run Chapel multilocale on VM cluster
source setenv.multiloc-ssh.bash



You can also refer to the official documentation in
$CHPL_HOME/doc/rst/usingchapel/multilocale.rst.
