Before Mutation: 
[A]

[A.B]
name = "sam"
number = 7
job = "programmer"

[A.C]
name = "Ben"
job = "programmer"


After Mutation: 
[A]

[A.B]
name = "sam"
number = 7
job = "programmer"

[A.B.C]
new-key-added = true

[A.C]
name = "Ben"
job = "programmer"


A.B.number = 7

KV pairs in table A.C
name = "Ben"
job = "programmer"



[B]
name = "sam"
number = 7
job = "programmer"

[B.C]
new-key-added = true

[C]
name = "Ben"
job = "programmer"


Should be the same as

[B]
name = "sam"
number = 7
job = "programmer"

[B.C]
new-key-added = true

[C]
name = "Ben"
job = "programmer"
