Whats Being Tested?
===================

The Fortran test framework is massive, and would be nearly impossible 
to replicate here.

We test to make sure that things of all types can make from the Chapel side to
the C side to the Fortran side and back, without becoming corrupted.

Each test file tests:
 1. the Fortran LAPACK call 
 2. the C LAPACKE call...
  * in row major order
  * in column major order
 3. the Chapel LAPACK call...
  * in row major order
  * in column major order
  
Additionally, dgees tests using a select function and on both sort ("S") and
no sort ("N") options

The types tested are:
real(32) ( c_float )
real(64) ( c_double )
complex(64) ( complex_float )
complex(128) ( complex_double )
LAPACK_D_SELECT2_LESS_THAN ( function pointer f( c_double, c_double )  )

LAPACK_Matrix
=============

LAPACK_Matrix is a container that was used to make the process of testing each 
LAPACK function much easier by encapsulating and providing explicit hooks
for fields that were required by LAPACK.

It is not meant to be used outside of the test framework.

See LAPACK_example.chpl for a 'real world' example of how to use LAPACK
