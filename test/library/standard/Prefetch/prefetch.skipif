# All 64-bit x86 has prefetch, but some 32-bit intel did not
# so it is necessary to supply -march=native for 32-bit testing.
# This could be achieved working through the CHPL_TARGET_CPU
# mechanism to be more robust for different platforms.
# In fact, this test works for me on 32-bit linux if CHPL_TARGET_CPU=native
# is set before testing begins...
# For now though, we just skip this test on 32-bit systems.
