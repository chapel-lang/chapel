feature request: Support pow() as a function.

Forgot about the ** (exponentiation) operator after my first reading of the
spec, and fell back on my knowledge of the C math library -- adding an extern
declaration:

    // Returns x raised to the y power.
    _extern proc pow(x : real(64), y : real(64)) : real(64);

That's the only version there is (no powf(), for example).  So that was it.

Arguments in favor:
 - We can say, "Chapel fully and natively supports the C math library."
 - Helpful for C-programmer retreads trying to use Chapel (usability).

Arguments against:
 - Pollutes the global namespace.
 - What about other data types?

Rebuttal of arguments against:
 - One name is not much.
 - The request is for the signature above only, for compatibility with the
   existing C standard.

Rebuttal of arguments for:
  [authors needed]
