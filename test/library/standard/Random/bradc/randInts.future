feature request: fill array with random integers

This captures a request from Richard Barrett in Nov/Dec 2007
to have a Random number fill routine for integer arrays.
I never completed it due to concerns about ability to generate
the full set of integers requested for certain data types or
min/max values.  See the commented out code in Random.chpl
for more details.
