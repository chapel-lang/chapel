feature request: RandomStream follower iterator

I'm backing out the support that I'd added for RandomStream follower
iterators because we don't have sufficient machinery in the leader/
follower story to be able to update the global cursor in a sufficiently
race-safe way.  This would be nice to continue to develop after the
release when we have more time.
