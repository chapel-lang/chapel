# These values are chosen to get one mode where the tests fails because we're
# out of stack and the other always succeeds. The tricky part is picking good
# sizes for all configurations. 2M should be high enough for all configurations
# It can't be any higher because  cygwin currently only support 2M max. 16K is
# the lowest we can go because fifo's min limit is 16K.
