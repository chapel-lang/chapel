# This test sets a low stack size expecting the program to fail with that
# amount, but it ends up succeeding with --fast because the stack sizes with
# --fast are really small.

CHPL_TARGET_PLATFORM <= cygwin

# The -E option is being used to set CHPL_RT_CALL_STACK_SIZE because the test
# tries to test two modes and I didn't want to create two identical tests with
# different .execenvs. However, the -E option doesn't work with launchers so I
# opted to just skip those configurations for now.
