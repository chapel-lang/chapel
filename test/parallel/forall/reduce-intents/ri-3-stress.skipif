# This test takes ~600 seconds to execute on chpbld01 with both 8.3 and 8.4
# versions of the cray compiler. It only takes ~60 seconds with gcc 4.8.2. For
# reference, on real XC hardware it takes ~5 seconds for both compilers. It
# seems like a result of chpbld01 having an unusual setup (cray might have bad
# code gen for an "XC" with old AMD hardware or something) and just being an
# older/slower machine in general.
