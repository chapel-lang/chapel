bug: "in" forall intent does not capture an array

Due to #5295.

Prior to #5295, it worked "for a wrong reason". That's because
the array is passed by default intent to _toStandalone(), which
stashes it into an iterator record then invokes chpl__autoCopy()
on the ir. So the array gets deep-copied as a field or this ir.
