error message: indicate that these are loop induction variables

Issue: #9127

When the initialization or type expression of a task-private variable
references an induction variable of its forall loop, we should
issue the same errors as in indvar-errors-1.chpl. This is more
helpful in preventing the user from mistakenly using induction variables
to initialize task-private variables.

The difference of indvar-errors-3 from indvar-errors-2 is that in the
former there are no like-named variables in an outer scope.
