bug: improper implementation of default forall intent for records

Currently when an outer variable of a record type is passed into
a forall loop by default intent, it is copied right before
executing each loop iteration, then the loop body operates
on such a copy.

According to the current rules, the loop body should operate directly
on the outer variable, seeing updates to it, although unable
to update it directly.
