bug: Cannot have begin statements in chpl__autoCopy() or anything called from it

Due to the implicit sync around main, all begin statements require the
global _endCount var for this sync.

If CHPL_VERIFY is set, this test gets an internal error during verify
after the parallel pass.  Otherwise, it asserts during the
removeUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls pass as it checks to make sure that
initCopy and autoCopy take no more than 1 argument.
