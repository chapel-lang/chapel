bug: a variable is heap-allocated, but not initialized

For this Chapel code:

  // at module level
  var rr = new RR();

the generated code is:

  static heap_RR rr; // in chpl__header.h

  static void chpl__init_test1(chpl___EndCount _endCount, int64_t _ln, chpl_string _fn) {
    ... no assignment to 'rr' prior to the following ...
    wrap_call_tmp = _construct_RR(0, &this8);
    chpl_check_nil(rr, 12, "test1.chpl");
    (rr)->value = wrap_call_tmp;
    ....

so the nil test fails.

I can observe this bug only with --local.

Note: this behavior is covered by this test:

  test/multilocale/vass/this-in-taskfns-in-ctors.chpl

(wanna-be test/parallel/taskPar/vass/this-in-taskfns-in-ctors.chpl).

When this bug is fixed, the present test
  this-in-begin-in-method.*
can be removed altogether - instead enable the following test:
  this-in-taskfns-in-ctors.chpl
for all configurations, by removing its skipif.
