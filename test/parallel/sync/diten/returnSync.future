semantic: Should we be able to return a sync variable?

The change to destroy sync variables when they leave scope makes returning
syncs problematic, especially since copying syncs is not recommended.  Should
it be possible to return a sync which would otherwise be cleaned up?

When resolving this future, please remove the skipif and test with
TASKS=qthreads
