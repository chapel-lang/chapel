bug: Compiler is attempting to bypass sync API

This program executed to completion when ChapelSyncvar was implemented
as a class.  Conversion to a record-wrapped class revealed that this
test, and only this test, caused the compiler to generate AST that
fetched fields of the class directly.

This in turn lead to a recognition that the semantics of sync class is
not as clear as it should be and so it was not clear how to support
this test for the new implementation.

A decision was made to define this as a future until the use cases for
sync class are better understood
