// Sync variables are useful for synchronizing between various threads of
// execution.  Besides containing a value, they also can oscillate between an
// empty state and a full state.  Usually, when a sync variable is empty,
// it means it is in the process of being modified, or some thread of execution
// is using some resource associated with this variable.  When this thread of
// execution no longer needs the variable or associated resource, it
// will change the state back to full.  Meanwhile, any other thread of
// execution that wishes to have access to the sync variable is
// blocked until the state of the variable becomes full.

// For the game of rock, paper, scissors, there will be three persons involved,
// represented by three independent threads of execution.  Two people actually
// play the game, while the third person acts as a referee, deciding who wins
// each round of the game.  At some point, one of the three announces he/she is
// tired of playing, at which time all three stop playing.

// This array contains the choice each player makes (rock, paper, or scissors)
// for a given round of the game.  When the state is full, it means
// the associated player has made his/her choice.  When the state is
// empty, it means the referee has seen the choice the player made.
