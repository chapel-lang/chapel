performance: local endCounts for non-0 locale's begin tasks

The implicit sync around user main requires all begins to synchronize
via the user main's endCount.  Unfortunately, this means that any
begin not on locale 0 has to do 2 remote updates to the endCount
variable.

It would be nice if each locale could have a private endCount.  When
that endCount went to 0, some task could inform locale 0.
Unfortunately, this might be tricky since non-0 locales don't know
when user main is done.

In any case, I'm not sure how often this case comes up, but I wanted
to commit this test since it helped my understanding of variable comm
counts for some tests.

Note that I had to put the conditional before the begin for this to
actually happen (any additional statements in the on body made it do
so also).  I think that some optimization may make it work as I would
expect in the simple case.
