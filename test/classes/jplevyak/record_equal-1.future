feature request: Implement field-by-field comparison in the default record equality function

This used to work, but the implementation used a generic default
implementation that was unsatisfactory.  Specifically, it resulted in
a difficult to track bug where the default == and != for empty records
compared to variables of *any* type always did nothing and always
returned true or false.

In an effort to go towards a more sane implementation, we disabled
this feature, which also disables comparison of records with variables
that are sub-records of the record.
