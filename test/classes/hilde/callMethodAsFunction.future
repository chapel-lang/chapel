feature request: Allow user to call methods as functions by supplying the this parameter explicitly.

Some scripting languages (e.g. Perl, PHP) allow the user to use method
call syntax or the underlying function-call syntax.  If we really want
to support "legacy" users, we should give them access to this
unsugared syntax.

Note that there is no ambiguity, because the method call is not
attached to a class.  The code and mangled name generated by the
compiler for a call to a method should be the same as a bare function
call.  That is, supporting this feature *should* be trivial in the
code generator and linker.  The only required change (that I can see)
would be in function lookup: We would have to normalize one form to
the other before resolving the function call against signatures stored
in the symbol table.
