feature request: Allow assignment to be defined as a method.

Currently, user-defined assignment is supported only for the signature:

  proc =(lhs:C, rhs:C)

(i.e. as a "free" function).  As an alternative, it is desirable to define it as
a method:

  proc C.=(rhs:C)

. For this to work, the compiler would have to try binding operator invocations
trying both free and method definitions:

  a = b; // Means both =(a,b) and a.=(b)


Currently, the compiler reports the error:

  methodAssignment.chpl:14: error: invalid method name

This message is produced in the normalize pass, and applies equally to all
operators (not just assignment).
