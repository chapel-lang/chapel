bug: forwarding does not work without 'this'
#5979

In the current compiler, scopeResolve is responsible for adding the
implicit 'this.' to a method call within a method. That's not happening
if the method called is a forwarded method, because scope resolve runs
before the set of forwarded methods is computed.

I think that the solution here is to move the implicit  'this.' logic
from scopeResolve into functionResolution. See also
