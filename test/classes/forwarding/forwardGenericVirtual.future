bug: forwarding generic virtual method causes resolution errors
#7786

The 'action' method on 'Rect' should only be called with rank-compatible Rects,
yet we try to call Rect(1).action(Rect(3)). Why?

I ran into this bug while working on array forwarding. The 'doiBulkTransfer'
method in BaseArr was causing bizarre resolution errors in the following test:

test/optimizations/sungeun/bulk_transfer/assign.chpl

Somehow the compiler was attempting to call doiBulkTransfer between a 1D
DefaultRectangular array of locales and a 3D DR array of reals.
