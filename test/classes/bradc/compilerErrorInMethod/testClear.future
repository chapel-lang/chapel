bug: compilerError being incorrectly encountered (?)

I'm almost certain that this is a bug.  I don't think that the
compilerError() should be encountered during function resolution
based on the given code.  See testClear-snap1.chpl and -snap2.chpl
for simpler versions of this test that work as expected.  In
particular, note that moving methods from the abstract to concrete
class (moving from -snap2.chpl to this version) is what causes
the problem.  It seemed to me that we might be overly conservative
about exploring what methods can be called.  It would be exciting if
this resulted in the compiler killing more dead code during
compilation...

Once this is fixed, a couple of halts in the changes to
ChapelArray.chpl that I should be checking in soon should
be able to be converted to compilerError() which would
be helpful to the user.
