# Forall array field initializer in a class or record fails with -valgrindexe
# The valgrind output is correct because this test does in fact read an uninitialized value.
# The failure arises because the forall expression to initialize an array field in a record
# causes the creation of a whole array assignment that references the yet-to-be-initialized 
# array on the left-hand side.
# The long-term solution will end up creating a literal array initializer and then just
# doing a pointer-copy to initialize the array field.  The whole-array assignment will not 
# be used, so the problem with referring to a not-yet-initialized array will be avoided.
# It is also possible that preventing iterators from capturing "this" values passed in
# by reference in iterator records would solve the problem.
