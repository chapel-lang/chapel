# --fast sets --no-checks
#
# --fast sets --no-checks and this test is explicitly checking that one
# of our runtime checks is working correctly. There's been debate as to
# whether tests like this should be suppressed or skipped. For now we
# suppress with the argument that we're testing that --fast actually
# turns our checks off. Note that we don't just turn checks on in the
# comopts since we wouldn't be testing the default behavior, and
# wouldn't be able to verify that checks are enabled by default. 

COMPOPTS <= --fast
