bug: Record initializer read uninitialized memory.

This is the same bug as reported for ArrayDomInClassRecord2, but manifests in a different
way.  The root problem is still that the parloopexpr used to initialize the array field in
a record is given access to and attempts to make a copy of the entire record.  In this
case, nothing bad happens when the program compiled for local execution.  When it is
compiled using --no-local, then at some point it attempts to access the array field and
discovers that the node portion of the array class pointer contains garbage.
