bug: Array field initializer accesses the containing record as a whole.

This is the same problem as in arrayDomInClassRecord.  It does not manifest as a fault
when run after being compiled for serial execution, but when run with valgrind, it is
still trying to access uninitialized memory.  This is because the parloopexpr refers to
the record as a whole, rather than just to the array it is trying to initialize (accessing
the dom as a separate data item is permissible).

When compiled with --no-local, the error manifests as an invalid node ID.  (With
CHPL_COMM=none, the node id should always be zero.)
