feature request: delete makes class references nil

It seems as though we have enough control over things in Chapel that
we could nil-ify a class reference once it has been deleted, and that
this would be a huge productivity benefit.  Currently, it appears that
the deleted class can still be referenced, though fortunately, it
causes the expected valgrind error.

(Obviously other references to this class instance could exist,                 
which would not be set to nil -- unless we wanted to support such
a thing as part of a more heavyweight debugging scheme.  But I'm
not as concerned about that case here).
