error message: iterator/promotion reported where none exists

This test is currently generating the error message:

thisWrongSize.chpl:12: In function 'this':
thisWrongSize.chpl:17: error: illegal access of iterator or promoted expression

Yet, there isn't any iterator or promoted expression here that I can
see.  The problem is that the data() array is decalred over a 32-bit
domain, but is being accessed using a 64-bit int.  The error message
in the .good file (or something equivalent or better) seems more appropriate.
