feature request: lifetime checking not flagging field initialization cases

If a field is initialized with a 'new borrow', the lifetime checker
isn't flagging that case.  This seems like a potentially easy thinko
for an user to make since an initializer almost feels as though it's
establishing a scope similar to the object being initialized, so it'd
be nice to point out that the borrow is not going to outlive the scope
of the initializer itself.
