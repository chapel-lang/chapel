feature request: lifetime checking not flagging loop expressions

If a loop expression allocates 'new borrow's, the deallocation will
take place within the scope of the loop expression, yet the lifeime
checker isn't flagging this case.  This seems like a potentially easy
thinko to make since the scope introduced by the forall expression
is so syntactically minimal in many forms.  It'd be nice to have
the lifetime checker flag such cases.

Note that I'm not particularly wed to the error message in this
test's .good, and am open to better wordings.
