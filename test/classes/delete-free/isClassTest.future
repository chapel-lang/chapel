bug: isClass() is inconsistent on managed class types vs. values

At present, isClass() queries return 'false' on 'owned' and 'shared'
types, but 'true' on their values.  This inconsistency seems like a
bug to me.

There's arguably a question over whether these should return `true` or
`false` given that we present the types to the user as class flavors
but their implementation uses a record.  Personally, I believe that
they should be `true` and that their record nature should not
influence the impact of these queries on them.
