bug: passing a 'Shared' object to a routine causes 'ref' mismatches

It seems this program should work as written, but it doesn't.  Adding
an explicit `ref` intent to foo() causes it to work, but Michael
agrees you shouldn't need to do that.  Michael thinks that adding
support for implicit conversions from 'Shared' to the wrapped class
type ought to solve this problem (though given the workaround I'm
not seeing how... not to suggest I'm doubting him... :)
