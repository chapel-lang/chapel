feature request: method overriding not to depend on arguments' names

At the moment, a method in the subclass overrides a method in the
superclass if "the names, types, and order of the formal arguments [are]
identical".

Requiring identical names seems unintuitive for people who have done
object-oriented programming before, as the popular OO languages e.g. Java
do not impose this requirement (AFAIK).

The non-intuitive-ness leads to code not working as expected.
Furthermore figuring out the cause is really non-trivial except
in simplest cases. Even if the programmer suspects a problem
with method overriding, the compiler at the moment offers no way
to investigate the issue.
