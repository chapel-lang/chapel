inout-subclass.chpl:7: warning: here, 'arg' is set to the result of borrowing from a 'new'
inout-subclass.chpl:7: note: if you meant to save the result of new, change the type of 'arg' to not be 'borrowed'
inout-subclass.chpl:7: note: if you meant to refer to another variable storing the 'new', use an explicit variable, e.g. 'var myOwned = new C(); var myBorrowed = myOwned.borrow();'
