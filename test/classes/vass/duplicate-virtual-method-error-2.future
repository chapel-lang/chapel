bug: compiler seg faults

Currently I get:
  error: seg fault [misc.cpp:259]
which is caused by an invalid 'child' when compute_call_sites() iterates at:
  forv_Vec(FnSymbol, child, *children)

The crash ensues when two virtual methods in a subclass override a
method in the superclass. In this case the ones in the subclass are ambiguous.

The test code can be slimmed a bit and still cause the crash, as long as
the compiler does not optimize things away:

  class C     { proc dup(){} }
  class D : C { proc dup(){} proc dup(){} }
  ((new D()):C).dup();
