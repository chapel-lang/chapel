bug: user-defined constructors for nested classes are broken

Currently the compiler demands an "outer" argument for the inner class's
constructor:

nested-class-with-user-defined-constructor-1.chpl:4: error: constructor for class 'inner' requires a generic argument called 'outer'

There are two problems with this:
* There is no reason for 'outer' to be generic (at least in this case).
* The 'outer' formal should not be required - because there are cases
  (like in this example) where the user does not wish to pass an explicit
  outer pointer.

Furthermore, if we suck it up and do add the "outer" argument,
the compiler can't handle it (this is an internal error):

nested-class-with-user-defined-constructor-1.chpl:4: error: SymExpr::var::defPoint is not in AST [expr.cpp:187]
