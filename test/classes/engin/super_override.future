bug: superclass' methods cannot be invoked from subclass

NOTES

- Keyword "super" seems to parse and work in some cases but, it fails without any
error message when used from inside the subclass

- One working example for _super_ is when you use it outside the class
  (see comment on line 30 in .chpl file)

- A method with another named(not an override) can call super.foo

- If there is an override in the subclass that calls super.foo, it always fails

- There is no .bad file because it gives different error messages under
  different configurations.

      - CHPL_COMM=gasnet, with oversubscription

      compiles, but application exits with status code 255, without any message

      - Standard config

      [1]    60958 bus error  ./a.out
