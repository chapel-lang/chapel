bug: nil checker misses an invalid program
(#11918)

This is a stepping stone towards #11918:
the compiler does not realize that 'obj' is nil with 
--no-legacy-classes

Once it does, it should report an error on Line 10,
however not on lines 13 and 16. The latter two are requested in
test/classes/vass/if-object-2.chpl

The error on Line 10 **is** reported if we replace 'obj: C?' with 'obj: C'
