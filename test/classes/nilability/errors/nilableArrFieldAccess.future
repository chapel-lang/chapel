error message: improve error message for field access of nilable

#17102

The source of the error here is that I didn't apply '!' to access the
class object, but the error message here isn't particularly clear,
particularly given that an array accessor does accept 1 argument, but
the error talks in terms of 0 arguments.

The error in the .good file is based off of what we print for a normal
field access in a case like this, though I think we could arguably do
even better by specializing the error message in terms of objects and
fields rather than "calls" since that's where things go bad.
