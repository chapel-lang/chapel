semantic: should writeln(someRecord) pass someRecord by value?

If we are OK with writeln() passing a record by value
somewhere in its implementation, then it is legal and required
for initialize() to run. So this test should indeed print (c = 2).

Otherwise we have a bug and this test should print (c = 1) for a[1].
