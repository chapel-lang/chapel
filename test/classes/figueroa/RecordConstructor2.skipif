# There is different behavior when --baseline is tossed, due to
# fNoRemoveCopyCalls preventing removeUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls() from running.
# Given that the compiler may remove autoCopy calls as long as it can prove they
# are not needed, the change in behavior is acceptable.
# On the other hand, the dependence of this behavior on the hidden call to
# initialize() makes it difficult to reason about.  The automatic call to
# initialize() should be deprecated.
# Also, if autoCopy calls are inserted only where they are needed, then the
# removeUnnecessaryAutoCopyCalls() pass can go away, and this skipif will also
# be unnecessary.
