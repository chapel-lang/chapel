bug: assigning param member triggers compiler error about multiple assignments to param

This program used to segfault until a compiler error was added for multiple
assignments to a param. If this behavior is still illegal within constructors,
a more descriptive compiler error would be nice. Here's the original
description of the segfault behavior, in case it's still useful:

For some reason, assigning the param 'foo' member in its constructor
causes a segfault rather than a useful error message.  Strangely,
looking at the IR, it appears that we're creating a foo[0] expression
somewhere along the line (indexing into a param enum?!?  Why?)
