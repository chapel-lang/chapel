bug: assigning param member causes segfault

For some reason, assigning the param 'foo' member in its constructor
causes a segfault rather than a useful error message.  Strangely,
looking at the IR, it appears that we're creating a foo[0] expression
somewhere along the line (indexing into a param enum?!?  Why?)
