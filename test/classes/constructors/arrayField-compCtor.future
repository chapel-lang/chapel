bug: compiler-generated constructors are insufficiently generic for arrays

This test, in combination with arrayField-userCtor.chpl, suggests that
compiler-generated constructors are too strict with respect to array
fields as compared to what you would expect the construcer signature
to look like (as illustrated in userCtor.chpl -- the initializer there
is more simplistic than what the compiler would introduce, but doesn't
seem to be the problem/difference as far as I can tell.

In the current compiler, this seems to be because array fields are
skipped in normalize.cpp w.r.t. the fixup_array_formals() call whereas
traditional methods (including constructors) enter this code path.

This is logged in issue #5289.
