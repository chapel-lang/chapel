bug: returns should not be allowed in inits (right?)

This test shows that while you can return from within an init(), we
probably shouldn't allow it.  The error messages in the .good are just
a proposed placeholder.  I'm open to other wordings and only printing
out the first such occurrence if the developer has other ideas.
