bug: multiple destructor calls for nested class in record

When defining a class within a record to use as one of its fields, we have a
bug where the destructor for the record is getting executed multiple times when
the record leaves scope.  This doesn't occur when the class is declared outside
the record, or when the record is made into a class and the destructor is called
manually.
