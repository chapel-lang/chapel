feature request: make fully specified generic record init work when no initializer with a generic argument per field is provided

Today, instances of the form:

var x: Foo(args) = new Foo();

fail if Foo has not defined an initializer with a generic argument per generic
field in the type.  Since the instance is just going to get overwritten with the
return value of the call on the right side of the assignment operator, it would
be nice to allow the user to write that form without failure, instead of forcing
them to never declare the explicit type for `x`.
