error message: limit the candidate output

At the moment, this test outputs an additional number of potential matches that
were rejected.  All of these appear to be generated for iterators, and are
likely not "proper initializers".  That is one problem.  This also makes it
apparent that users which write an incorrect call to an initializer are likely
to getting increasingly more verbose and unintelligible error messages as we
convert our library types to use the new initializers.  Something should be done
to limit the number of candidates we show in such error cases.

When this is fixed, remove this version of the test and the prediff on
where-clause4.chpl
