bug: array expression creation relies on zero args init() to store records

We currently have an issue with record initializers where creating an array of
them via the expression syntax (`var x = [i in someRange] new rec(args);`)
requires the type to have defined a zero argument initializer.  Is this
appropriate behavior, or should the initialization of this array be fine without
that initializer?

When this is resolved, please update test/users/vass/km/array-of-records-crash2
and its explicit counterpart to use initializers.
