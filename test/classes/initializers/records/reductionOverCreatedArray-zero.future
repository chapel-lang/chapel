bug: issue with initializers on bigint type being returned in certain situations

Returning directly the result of a reduction over an array created in the same
expression with a size of 1..0 causes an execution segfault at the deinitializer
call.  If the reduction result is saved into a temporary first, we still
encounter the bug.  However, if we save the created array into a temporary, the
program will always execute correctly.

This version covers returning the result of the reduction directly when the
array is created in the same expression.
