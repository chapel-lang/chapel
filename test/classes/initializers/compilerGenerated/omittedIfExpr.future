bug: conditional expressions not supported in fields due to default initializers

Currently, default initializers get generated improperly when one or more fields
are given an initial value that is a conditional expression.  I thought I had a
path that would solve this issue quickly, but it turns out to be more involved,
so save this test as a future for the moment.

Michael suggests that the right solution is probably to rewrite if expressions
so that they are handled by their own AST node in place instead of creating
a FnSymbol for them that is then moved out of the immediate scope.  However,
this will be more work than is reasonable for this side bug at the moment, so
put it off for now.
