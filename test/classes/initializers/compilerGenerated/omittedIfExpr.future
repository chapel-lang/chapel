bug: conditional expressions not supported in fields due to default initializers

Currently, default initializers get generated improperly when one or more fields
are given an initial value that is a conditional expression.  I thought I had a
path that would solve this issue quickly, but it turns out to be more involved,
so save this test as a future for the moment.
