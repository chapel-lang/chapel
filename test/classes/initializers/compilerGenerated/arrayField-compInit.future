bug: compiler-generated initializers are insufficiently generic for arrays

This test, in combination with arrayField-userInit.chpl, suggests that
compiler-generated initializers are too strict with respect to array
fields as compared to what you would expect the initializer signature
to look like (as illustrated in arrayField-userInit.chpl -- the
initializer there is similar to what I would expect the compiler to
produce, yet doesn't seem to cause problems).

This was historically a problem with constructors as well (issue
#5289), but I've retired that since we're working on retiring
constructors.  I'd been hoping that when we introduced compiler
initializers, the rewrite would cause the problem to go away as well,
but no such luck it seems.

This is logged in issue #6711.
