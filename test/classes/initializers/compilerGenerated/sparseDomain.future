bug: default initializers with arrays using sparse domains get errors

An array field with a sparse domain that is stored as another field gets the
error "sparse arrays can't be zippered with anything other than their domains
and sibling arrays" when we try to set its initial value using the default
initializer's default value for the argument.

This issue is regardless of whether the domain field was declared concrete or
generic (though it was originally found in the case where the domain field was
generic).
