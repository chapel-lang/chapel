error message: accidental call to superclass initializer

It seems to me that calls to 'new subclass(...)' (like 'new D' in this
example) shouldn't resolve to superclass initializers, yet that's what
seems to be happening here, resulting in a type mismatch, presumably
in some internal code generated from new expressions.
