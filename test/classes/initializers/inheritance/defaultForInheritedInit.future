feature request: default initializers for single-init inheritance cases
#8232

When converting some code from constructors to initializers, it seemed
natural to me in a case like this that the subclass should get a
default initializer that was essentially a pass-through to the parent
class initializer, yet that didn't happen.  From a productivity
perspective, I think it should.
