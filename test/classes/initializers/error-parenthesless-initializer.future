semantic: disallow parenthesis-less initializers

Brad and Vass feel that Chapel should not allow initializer methods to
be declared without parentheses.

Note: in the current implementation one can write both initializers
(both with no arguments) at the same time. Then when invoking
new classname(), the compiler finds that call ambiguous.
