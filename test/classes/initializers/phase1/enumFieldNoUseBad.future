error message: Initializer verification is hiding an enum error message

This test should generate an error message for the user, because they are
trying to access one of the enum's constant values without either the type
prefix or `use`ing the enum.  However, we never reach the error message that
normally gets generated - instead, we blow up during the verification of the
initializer.  Initializers should let this go through so the normal message is
given.

The same is also likely true of bad methods, I suspect.
