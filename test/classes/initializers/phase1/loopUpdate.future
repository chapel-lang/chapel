feature request: omitted initialization insertion point

Brad suggested that it might be good to have code like this be valid.  The
compiler is already inserting omitted initialization for the array, but the
current implementation places the omitted initialization right before the
super.init() call, making the `for` loop access a field before it has been
initialized.  If the omitted initialization was placed right after the last
initialized field, then the `for` loop would be valid.

Is this desirable, or letting users write a bug?  Should this be part of the
specification, or left as an implementation detail (and so maybe undefined
behavior)?  See discussion in https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/6568
