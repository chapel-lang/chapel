bug: domain field doesn't get dmap set up correctly

Update to original text below: It seems that there's a valgrind
failure that makes the behavior of this test in --local mode
nondeterministic.  As a result, my initial diagnosis below might be
wrong.  Changing this to a valgrind-only future for the time being to
ensure stability in testing.

In this test, the 'D' field is declared in terms of dmap 'C' yet
inspecting the code within the Cyclic distribution in the place where
the failure occurs, it is clear that D's distribution is not referring
to C based on the 'targetLocDom' fields (C has a correct non-empty
'targetLocDom' field while D.dist's is still empty).  This shows up as
an array out of bounds error because in setting up D, it tries to
index into the target locale array and fails.  My guess is that this
is because domain maps do not yet use initializers, but it may be
related to issue #8503 instead.

(Note that this can be worked around by declaring min/max fields and
using them to set up D using its default field initializer rather than
the body of init().  But ultimately, this form should work too, I
believe).
