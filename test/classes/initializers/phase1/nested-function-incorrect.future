bug: use of nested functions permits use-before-def within init()

This test shows that when nested functions are used, we can read
fields before they are initialized in initializers.  The -correct.chpl
version demonstrates that this pattern can be nice (if, say, the
computation to initialize the expression is larger than you'd want to
jam into the initialization expression slot).
