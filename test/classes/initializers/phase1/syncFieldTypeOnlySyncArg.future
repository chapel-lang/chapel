bug: sync arguments read, not copied during Phase 1

Today, if you pass in a sync to an initializer in order to use it as one of the
fields of the type, we insert a readFE of the argument provided.  However, it
seems more likely that the desire was to utilize the sync itself as the field
no matter its state, rather than assume the sync was full.

This particular case seems less likely, but it closely mimics the behavior of
default initializers when no value is provided for the sync field.  Is this
something we would like to solve in both cases?

When this future is resolved, you can remove the .timeout file.
