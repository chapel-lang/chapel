bug: method calls in Phase 1 of initialization not detected if method has overloads

As I suspected, our strategy of detecting method calls in Phase 1 of
initialization gets fooled when there are multiple versions of a method.  This
is because scope resolve doesn't arbitrarily keep one of the functions it finds,
it just punts if there are multiple.
