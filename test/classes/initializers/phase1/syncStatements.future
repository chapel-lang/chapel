feature request: sync statements in phase 1

Philosophically, it should not be a big deal for phase 1 initializers to
include a sync statement. However, because of error-handling changes to
do with sync statements, the matching for phase 1 initializers can no
longer allow this pattern without also allowing try/catch. This issue
should be revisited after error handling and initializers have both
stabilized more.
