bug: support secondary initializers defined in other modules

This test wants to match against the secondary initializer defined in the same
module as the call, but instead tries to utilize the default constructor.

With --force-initializers, we run into an ambiguity between the explicit
initializer and the default one.

While it was hoped that deprecating constructors would ultimately resolve this
issue, the --force-initializers failure indicates that there is likely a little
more work to be done.
