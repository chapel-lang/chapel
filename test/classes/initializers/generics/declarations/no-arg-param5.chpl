// Exercises basic declarations of instantiations.  Here, the type creator has
// declared an initializer with no arguments.  Basically, the type is not really
// generic.

// This handles the case where we reuse the type instantiation, but reverses the
// order of calls

  param p;

  proc init() {

var foo3 = new borrowed Foo();
var foo: borrowed Foo(4); // We can create an instantiation with p = 4
var foo2: borrowed Foo(4);

writeln(foo.type == foo3.type);
writeln(foo.type:string);
writeln(foo2.type: string);
