semantic: what happens when multiple initializers would match to same declaration?

Should we:
- Error when someone tries to declare an instance that would use one of them,
  since we can't distinguish between wanting the generic var version or the type
  argument version?
- Resolve the conflict by choosing the one with more type arguments, and
  document this decision?

In this test case, we would want an error message regardless, since there isn't
a good way to resolve the conflict.
