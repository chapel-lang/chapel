// Exercises basic declarations of instantiations.  Here, the type creator has
// in their benevolence declared an initializer with an argument for the param
// field that is used to give the same value to the param field.  The
// initializer also has some side effects - we probably shouldn't see those,
// since the type isn't getting initialized, merely declared.

    p = pVal;
    writeln(pVal);
