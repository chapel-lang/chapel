semantic: what happens when multiple initializers would match to same declaration?

Should we:
- Error when someone tries to declare an instance that would use one of them,
  since we can't distinguish between wanting the generic var version or the type
  argument version?
- Resolve the conflict by choosing the one with more type arguments, and
  document this decision?

In this test case, should we perhaps consider resolving to the one with less
arguments overall?
