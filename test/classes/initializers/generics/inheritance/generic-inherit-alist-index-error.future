bug: alist must be indexed by positive integer (generic inheritance inits)

Something about this code trips an internal error on alists that I
don't recognize regarding that they must be indexed by a positive
integer.  Though I haven't looked into it, I'd guess it's due to the
lack of fields in the classes and probably a pretty easy fix.
