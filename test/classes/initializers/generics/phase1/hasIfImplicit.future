feature request: generic initializers if statement support improvement

A generic field is set in two different places in this initializer.  This is
okay, because it is in separate branches of an if statement.  However, the way
we build the generic instantiation doesn't take the if statement into account,
meaning that we encounter both statements.  This should be fixed.
