semantic: Should nested functions that modify fields be callable in Phase 1?

I think the answer should be no, but I'm not sure how to distinguish nested
functions that are valid to call in Phase 1 versus those that can only be called
in Phase 2, especially if the nested function is "defined in Phase 2" (even
though the definition point of a nested function is only meaningful in terms of
whether the symbol is visible in that scope)

Today param fields give an error message, but that message is not ideal.
