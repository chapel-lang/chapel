bug: user-defined initializers for nested classes are broken

Currently the compiler demands an "outer" argument for the inner class's
initializer:

nested-class-with-user-defined-initializer-1.chpl:4: error: initializer for class 'inner' requires a generic argument called 'outer'

There are two problems with this:
* There is no reason for 'outer' to be generic (at least in this case).
* The 'outer' formal should not be required - because there are cases
  (like in this example) where the user does not wish to pass an explicit
  outer pointer.
