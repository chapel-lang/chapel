feature request: error message for on statements with --local

Today, it is an error to perform super.init() calls in an on statement.
However, we only trigger the error message for --no-local compilation.  It would
be better to trigger the error message regardless of whether compilation is
local, no-local, or CHPL_COMM!=none.

When this is resolved, remove this test and the .compopts file for all the on
statement tests.
