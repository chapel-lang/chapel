bug: I/O on class hierarchies seems broken

#7118

In this test, I would expect the 'child' class to inherit the 'parent'
class's writeThis() routine, as with any other inherited method.  Or,
if we decided that compiler-generated writeThis() routines should
occur for child classes, that it would call into the parent class
writeThis() as part of its definition.  In either case, I would expect
the halt to be reached when printing out a child class, where it is
not here.

While I understand the current behavior, it seems inconsistent with
the behavior in classIOinHierarchy-override.chpl for static type C,
dynamic type E, in which D's writeThis() _is_ called.  I can't
explain this.
