======================
chplvis test directory
======================

This directory consists of a number of tests for the chplvis program.
Each Chapel program here uses the "VisualDebug" module.

Automated tests only test to see if the programs run correctly.  It
requires a human to verify that the generated data for chplvis is
correct.

overhead: Programs that only use VisualDebug (or a for loop) and 
          should not generate any tasks or communication.

benchmarks-hpcc:  Programs taken from test/release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc and
                  had VisualDebug added.
