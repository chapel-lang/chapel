feature request: argv[0] should not reveal '_real' binary

In my opinion, if a launcher is used, argv[0] should not print the
name of the '_real' binary, beecause that's not what the user is
running.  Moreover, such handling of argv[] arguments would ideally be
handled in the launcher before queueing/launching (i.e., why sit in a
queue only to get --help output?).  When the argv feature was added,
we kicked around other ways of doing argument processing (e.g., having
modules define handlers that would be called by the runtime) which
might be more amenable to moving into the launcher code than the
current argv approach.  It may be worth reconsidering those ideas as
a path toward improving this situation.
