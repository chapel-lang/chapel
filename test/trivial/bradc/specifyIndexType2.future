semantic: explicit type on indices

should we allow these?

how does this interact with var iterators since we are not doing an
assignment here?  does the type have to match exactly?  this is
similar to return type specifications.  how is this done?

unimplemented feature: explicit typing of for/forall index variable

We should allow the type of a for/forall index variable to be
specified if the user wants it to be.  This used to be in the spec,
not sure whether it is anymore or not.
