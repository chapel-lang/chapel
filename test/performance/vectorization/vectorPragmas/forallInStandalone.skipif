# With numa the range leader has 2 yield points in it, so there will be double
# the number of vectorized loops for the standalone iterator (this is a good
# thing.) I could add a compgood-numa or something and have an extra prediff
# for this test, but it doesn't seem worthwhile since numa really only affects
# the leader iterators, and thus the number of loops that might be marked, I
# don't think it provides any additional benefit to test this.
# Other non-flat locale models are likely to have similar issues.
