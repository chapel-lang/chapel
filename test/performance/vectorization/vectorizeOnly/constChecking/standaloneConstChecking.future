bug: Const checking on the index var of standalone iters is broken

This bug is the same as statements/elliot/loops/modifyIndicesStandalone. This
test is meant to ensure that vectorizeOnly doesn't break index var const checking,
but index var const checking is currently broken for standalone itererators.
