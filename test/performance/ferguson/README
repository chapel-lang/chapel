This directory contains performance tests of comm counts.
These also have a correctness component and are meant to fail
correctness testing if the comm counts rise above a certain maximum.

For performance testing, these generate quite a few graphs in
different configurations. The gengraphs.bash script generates
most of the required performance testing files.

To run performance testing in this directory, do:

  start_test -performance -perflabel cc-  .
