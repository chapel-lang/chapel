performance: ref arguments shouldn't always be wide

The current compiler always implements 'ref' arguments as wide pointer
types even when the arguments are provably local.  We should really be
more careful about when to widen reference arguments since wide values
add runtime overhead, make code complexity worse, and disable other
optimizations (like fast-on optimizations -- see the opEquals test in
this same directory).
