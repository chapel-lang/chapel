# This test serves as a sentinel for compiler performance testing to prevent
# a pass group (like front-end, back-end, or middle end) from being moved,
# deleted, or renamed. These groups represent top-level "stages" of the
# compiler, and should remain as-is in the --print-passes output. They are
# intended to abstract over the exact details of passes and their ordering,
# so that graph historical data doesn't have to be modified whenever passes
# change.
#
# compilerPerformance.perfkeys is used by compiler performance testing to time
# the pass groups. It is also used by this test to let you know if you broke
# compiler performance testing. Prior to this, compiler performance tracking quickly
# became out of date with missing passes and timings being associated with the
# wrong pass. Note that you should _not_ be modifying compilerPerformance.perfkeys 
# to fix compiler performance testing (at the very least, the fix would
# require updating .dat and .graph files, but as mentioned above, the whole
# purpose of the three pass groups is to avoid doing this in the future).
# Instead, you should probably just make sure the three pass groups are
# still present and named as before.
