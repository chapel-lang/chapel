#  Application output difference test for ZPL
#
# This is the sub_test that used to appear in all
# subdirectories, but we've now hoisted it to the
# top directory to avoid its over-replication and
# support modifications to it.
#
# The rules:
#
# 1) by default, all subdirectories under the
#    test directory will be run unless they contain
#    a file called NOTEST
#
# 2) if the directory contains a sub_test script,
#    that script will be run.  Otherwise, this one
#    will  be.
#
# 3) if the directory does not contain a sub_test
#    script, the start_test script will look for
#    files named COMPOPTS and EXECOPTS and will
#    add these to the zplcompopts and zplexecopts
#    flags, respectively.
