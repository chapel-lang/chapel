bug: initializing a tuple of ranges requiring a coercion fails

This future shows that when initializing a tuple of ranges that
requires a coercion, we get an illegal lvalue error (apparently
due to a compiler-generated coercion temp?).

Upon fixing this, we could remove a hack-y workaround from DSIUtil.chpl
in bulkCommTranslateDomain().
