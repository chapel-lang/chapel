#14902

When iterators yield a tuple expression capturing a const element by
and then that tuple expression is returned by `const ref`, the
const element is mutable after yield (e.g., within a forall).

There are two tests here. Oddly enough, only the second reflects the
assignment in the global `gElem` (I would expect the first to do so
as well, but it does not - very odd).
