feature request: Tuples can't be assigned with non-default-sized types

This is due to not supporting param tuples and so param-coercion is not applied.
See Github issue #6000 for more details on why this is not supported today.

To summarize:

In thinking about what it would take to implement these more complex param
cases, we have a difficult choice to make: Do we explicitly teach the compiler
how to reason about each of these types (tuples, ranges, domains, arrays) at
compile-time? Or do we teach the compiler how to reason about arbitrary records
and classes at compile-time (which are used under the covers to implement most
of these types) in which case any object can be a param and these just fall out?
The tradeoff is arguably that the former would be simpler but introduce more
special case code (and duplicated code with the modules, arguably) while the
latter is a much larger endeavor to take on.
