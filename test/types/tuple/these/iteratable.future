bug: Cannot iterate over a (homogenous) tuple of iteratable expressions that yield the same type

In this example:

   for ij in (i1(), i2()) do
     writeln(ij);

the first tuple (i1(), i2()) is a tuple of arrays, yet their types are
represented by the iterator record, so that the test for homogenous
tuple fails during function resolution.
