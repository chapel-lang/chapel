bug: Tuples of domains cannot be default-initialized

The compiler-generated _defaultOf() function for a tuple that includes
1 or more domains is incorrect.  The elements with domain type will be
uninitialized. This is the result of a confluence of multiple problems
in normalize and resolution especially for PRIM_INIT in the face of the
specialized internal support for domains.
