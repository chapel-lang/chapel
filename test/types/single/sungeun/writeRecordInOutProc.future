bug: Sync/single vars in records not properly copied when they are out or inout arguments

When passing records with sync/single var fields to functions with out
or inout intent, we copy the pointer to the sync/single field.  When
we copy the record out (which we do by value), the sync/single var may
be in a state that causes deadlock for the sync var case or an invalid
additional write for the single var case.

Note that the single var out argument test case works simply because
we can't write the variable again to test that it's the same instance.
We could try to compare the C pointers using C extern functions.

FYI, we do not currently enforce writing to variables that have const
(default) intent or in intent, so similar tests that use these two
intents types will fail, but that is another bug that I believe is
documented elsewhere (maybe).
