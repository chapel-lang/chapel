bug: cast from string to uint(32) on ILP32 clips to LONG_MAX

When the underlying C sizeof(long) is 4, a string representing an
integer between LONG_MAX and ULONG_MAX will be clipped to LONG_MAX
when cast to uint(32).  This is due to strtol() in the casting code.

This isn't a problem when sizeof(long) is 8, as LONG_MAX is large
enough for any uint(32).  And casting to uint(64) goes down a
different path.
