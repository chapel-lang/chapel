bug: upper and lower case Unicode characters do not always encode to the same number of UTF-8 bytes

The lower case German sharp S encodes to two bytes in UTF-8, while the
upper case version encodes to three bytes.  String methods that make
case changes in place currently assume the same number of bytes.
