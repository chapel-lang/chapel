String Implementation Test Suite
================================

The tests in this suite are intended to test string implementations.
Any string implementation can be plugged in by changing the config
type 'string_impl' (and including the proper module for the
implementation).

The suite it is particularly heavy on testing memory leaks using the
existing string interface.  As the interface grows and changes, new
tests should be added.
