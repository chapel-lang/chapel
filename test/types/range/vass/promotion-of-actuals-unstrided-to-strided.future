feature request: allow an unstridable range to be implicitly coerced to stridable when it is passed as an arguments to a function

Currently this coersion is supported when assigning to a variable.
Would be nice to allow this when passing ranges as arguments.

Allowing the reverse coersion (with a runtime check)
is perhaps less desirable/advisable.
