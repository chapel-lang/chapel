feature request: allow a range to be implicitly coerced to a range with a bigger idxType when it is passed as an arguments to a function

... that is, when the actual's idxType is implicitly coercible to the
formal's idxType.

Currently this coersion is supported when assigning to a variable.
Would be nice to allow this when passing ranges as arguments.
