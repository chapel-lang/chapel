feature request: distinguish ambiguous and unambiguous range alignments when printing

When printing a range, I'd like to see an indication that its
alignment is ambiguous, when that is the case. An ambiguous alignment
could be printed as '?' (as in .good) or a legal Chapel expression
could be provided, e.g.

   (.. by 2)(1..5) printed for the range 1..5 by 2 align ?

Right now 1..5 by 2 and 1..5 by 2 align ? print out the same,
which is unsatisfactory.
