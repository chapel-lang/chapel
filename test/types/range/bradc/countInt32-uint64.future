error message: # operator applied to bad types

When the # operator is applied to bad commbinations of integral
types, we should generate a more specialized error message.  The
current one refers to +, which isn't ideal:

countInt32-uint64.chpl:3: error: illegal use of '+' on operands of type uint(64) and signed integer
