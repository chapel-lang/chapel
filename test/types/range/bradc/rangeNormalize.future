feature request: range normalizer

The general thrust of this feature request is that it would be nice to
have a method that put a range into a normalized form.  I'm not
entirely sure I know what the right normalized form should be, but I'm
going to assert: (1) aligned low and high bounds; (2) positive stride
just to get the discussion started.  The idea behind this is that any
two ranges that describe the same indices should have the same
representation when they've been normalized.

I'm going a bit back and forth about whether this method should create
a new range or modify the existing range.  I've taken the latter
approach under Tom's argument that methods should arguably modify the
'this' range rather than create a new one.  In which case, we'd
probably want a standalone normalize routine in a standard
RangeUtils.chpl module or something like that for people that didn't
want to (or couldn't) modify the range in question.

A similar capability could/should be added for rectangular domains
though I haven't written a future for that here.
