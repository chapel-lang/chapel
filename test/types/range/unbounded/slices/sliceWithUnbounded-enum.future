bug: slicing with unaligned bool/enum unbounded range ignores array bounds

In the current range implementation, when we apply 'by' to an
unbounded enum/bool range, we use its implied missing bound so that
iteration will work correctly.  However, this can make it not inherit
the array's bound when slicing as it should.

I think the fix here is probably to have 'by' store a sentinel
alignment (like -1 if we switch to always storing the alignment as
0..<stride?)  and then have the iterator(s) compute the aligned bound
on the fly when that sentinel value is present.
