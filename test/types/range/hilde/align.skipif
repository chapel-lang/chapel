# This test exposes a bug in the Intel compiler that appears only when debugging
# is disabled (hard to debug).
# I has to do with the result of the modulus operator having the wrong sign, and
# appears only in the context of chpl__mod (instantiated for int64_t operands).
# A separate test (expressions/hilde/divByNeg) shows that normally the sign of
# the result of '%' tracks the sign of the first argument (if the second
# argument is positive).  But the Intel compiler changes its mind for this
# particular test case.

# The PGI compiler exhibits the same behavior.  Both are apparently GCC
# derivatives, so the similar behavior is not too surprising.
