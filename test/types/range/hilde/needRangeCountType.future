bug: Cannot represent the length of a maximal range.

On a range like min(int)..max(int), length returns zero rather than the actual
length of the range (which in this case would be max(uint) + 1.

Calculations like these should be allowed to proceed without loss of precision,
and then report an error if an attempt is made to shoehorn the resulting value
back into a smaller type.
