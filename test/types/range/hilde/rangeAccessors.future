feature request: Allow write access to the fields in a range.

Direct access to the fields in a range allows updating the range without having
to create a new one.  This is particularly useful if one wishes to update the
high or low bound while leaving everything else unchanged.

Also, at present, there is no such thing as an un-by operator, so to change the
stride of a range, you would have to start from scratch, which can be a bit
verbose.  Compare:

    r1 = r1.low..r1.high by s align r1.alignment;

    r1.stride = s;

Also, the latter form is easier to read.  Compare:

    "r1 is a range with a low bound of r1.low, a high bound of r1.high, a stride
    of s and an alignment of r1.alignment."  "Which because I am clever and I
    know about all the fields in a range, I interpret to be the same as r1 with
    its former stride replaced by s."

    "The stride of r1 has been replaced by s."


On the other hand, the same arguments can be applied to keeping the fields of a range
constant as for making strings immutable -- that the performance benefits associated with
being able to copy the record freely, without having it tied to subsequent changes in the
original far outweighs the benefits of being able to modify an existing object.

In multithreaded and especially in distributed execution environments, the benefits of
making ranges immutable is pretty clear-cut.  That estimation is less true for strings,
depending on their size.

In summary, if strings are immutable then ranges should definitely be.  Conversely, if ranges
are mutable, strings should be mutable also.
