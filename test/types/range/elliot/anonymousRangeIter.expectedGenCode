# This is the generated code that we expect with the anonymous range iteration
# applied. This check is pretty fragile since it's hard-coding names of
# variables and other things in the check, but I don't expect it to change
# that often. If it becomes a problem it can be revisited. If this test
# changes and this output needs to be updated the important things to look for
# are that there are no range constructions for the anonymous ranges, and that
# for strided anonymous ranges where the stride is known at compile time, the
# "C for loop" uses "<, <=, >, or >="

# I would expect the output to change if argument names for the direct
# iterators are changed, copy propagation is updated, or something else
# changes that makes variables names different or the formatting of c for
# loops to change.
