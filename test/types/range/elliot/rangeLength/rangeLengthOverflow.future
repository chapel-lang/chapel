feature request: Want warning/error when range.size will overflow

The length of maximal uint ranges such as 0:uint(8)..255:uint(8) overflows.
This is currently because the return type of length is the index type of the
range. You might be able to return chpl__maxIntTypeSameSign(idxType) for the
smaller uints, but for the uint(64) case, there's really nothing you can do
about it though.

This overflow is more annoying for int ranges where things like
(0:int(8)..127..int(8)).size result in overflow. Currently this case isn't
being tested in this .future because integer overflow is undefined.

I'm not sure if there's actually anything we can do about this issue over
having range.size returning uint(64)/int(64) instead of the index type but
that only masks the problem for some ranges.

I think I'd at least prefer some error checking that will report that overflow
is going to occur so the user isn't completely surprised by this.
