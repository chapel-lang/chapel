feature request: handle assignments to atomic variables consistently

Since we generally disallow direct assignment to an atomic variable,
we should disallow it even when the r.h.s. is an atomic.

Alternatively (or perhaps even preferably) we should allow direct
reading/writing of atomic variables, with appropriate atomic semantics.
