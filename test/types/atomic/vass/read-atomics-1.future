feature request: handle reading of atomic variables consistently

Right now test/release/examples/primers/atomics.chpl,
about the only spec on atomics, requires that atomic variables
be read only using read(). Therefore an appropriate message
should be generated by the compiler.

Today I get this:
  read-atomics-1.chpl:3: error: Cannot assign to int(64) from AtomicT(int(64))

which makes me think that it is allowed but there is a glitch in the compiler.

I guess the preferred course of action is to allow reading of atomic
variables but ensure it is done with atomic semantics, i.e. by
invoking read() implicitly.
