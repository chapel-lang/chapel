feature request: handle reading of atomic variables consistently

This is the same as read-atomics-1.future,
except currently writeln(a) is permitted.

Again, the point is that ideally either all reads and writes to atomics
are allowed directly or all of them are disallowed.
Right now some accesses are allowed while some others are not.
