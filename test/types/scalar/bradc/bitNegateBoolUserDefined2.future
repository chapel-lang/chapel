feature request: define ~ on bools in user module

The version of ~ on bool in ChapelBase.chpl can't be marked "compiler
generated" i.e. last resolt because then the int versions will be called
(with a coercion).

The fact that this program generates an ambiguity instead of prefering
the more locally scoped one in A seems to be more about module
scopes than about ~.
