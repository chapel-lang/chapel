Bug: Internal error should be user error

This test was sent by Chris Wailes to chapel-developers on
Apr 22, 2014 and, from what I can see, was never filed against
the testing system.  The error message proposed here is just a
placeholder.  I'm open to other        sufficiently clear user  (rather
than internal) messages   as well.
