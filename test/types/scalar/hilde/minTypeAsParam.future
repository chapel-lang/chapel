feature request: Implement type minimum and maximum values as param properties.

min() and max() on types currently return a run-time value rather than a compile-time value.  These values should be available at compile time, since we already know the size of the representation.

Also, I'd prefer a property syntax (like a field accessor) for this kind of type trait query.
