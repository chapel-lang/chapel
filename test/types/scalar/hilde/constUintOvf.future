feature request: Silent uint rollover (param and runtime).
area: safety, productivity
severity: 1 -- Program continues running, possibly incorrect result.
priority: med

By default, the compiler ought to alert the user when the representation of a
quantity rolls over.  Some routines assume monotonicity -- which can be violated
close to the representational limits and lead to incorrect results.
