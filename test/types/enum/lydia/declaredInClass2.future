feature request: 'use' enums at class scope

The spec says that it is legal to declare an enum within the top level scope of
a class (as well as classes, records, and unions).  However, trying to use one
of the constants declared in that enum as the initial value of field runs into
issues.

This future covers trying to 'use' the internal enum, so that the field can
access its constant without resorting to explicit naming.  The spec does not
currently permit this, but it seems reasonable to desire it.  Otherwise, you'd
end up writing a 'use' statement in every method if you wanted to do something
with the enum type.
