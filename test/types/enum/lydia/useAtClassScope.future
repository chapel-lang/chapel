feature request: 'use' enums at class scope

This future covers trying to 'use' an enum, so that a field can access its
constant without resorting to explicit naming.  The spec does not currently
permit this, but it seems reasonable to desire it.  Otherwise, you'd end up
writing a 'use' statement in every method if you wanted to do something with the
enum type.
