bug: enums declared in class scope can't have fields use their type

The spec says that it is legal to declare an enum within the top level scope of
a class (as well as classes, records, and unions).  However, trying to use that
enum runs into issues.

This future covers omitted initialization of a field declared with that enum
type as its type (and explicitly naming a constant to set it in Phase 2)
