bug: function-scoped enum can't be initialized with global param
#7681

In the following code:

    enumScopeTest();
    param x = 2;
    proc enumScopeTest() {
      enum Numbers {one=x, two, three};
      writeln(Numbers.one);
    }

the enum constant 'one' gets initialized to 'x' before 'x' gets resolved.
Should this work?
