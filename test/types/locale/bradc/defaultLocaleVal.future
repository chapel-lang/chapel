bug: no default locale value

This test shows that we've never established a default
locale value.  I propose that it should be Locales(0)
since this locale will always be guaranteed to exist.
The current behavior is a nil dereference, which seems
inappropriate since locales are meant to have a value
type semantics from the user's perspective.
