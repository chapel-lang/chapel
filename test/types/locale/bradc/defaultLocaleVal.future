bug: no default locale value

This test shows that we've never established a default
locale value.  I propose that it should be Locales(0)
since this locale will always be guaranteed to exist.

The current behavior is a compilation error related to a borrowed class
type but that might not be appropriate since locales are meant to have a
value type semantics from the user's perspective.
