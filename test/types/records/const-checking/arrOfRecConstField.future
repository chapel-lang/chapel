bug: can't create array literals from records with const fields

This test shows that we can't currently create array literals from
records that have const fields even though it seems like we should be
able to (since this is the initialization of the array value/literal,
not a re-assignment to an array).

The prevailing theory is that this is due to the fact that the record
doesn't define an initializer and so today is getting a
compiler-generated _constructor_ which doesn't support copy
initialization.  The theory is that once the compiler is generating
initializers, all will be better.  That said, I can't seem to get the
test working by providing an explicit initializer either.
