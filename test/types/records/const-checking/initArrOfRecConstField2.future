bug: should be able to init arrays of records of const fields

This test demonstrates that arrays of records that have const fields
can't be initialized, though it seems that they should be able to.  As
Mike points out, the zeroth order concern here is that we can't create
array literals of record values with const fields as
arrOfRecConstField.chpl shows.

The prevailing theory is that this is due to the fact that the record
doesn't define an initializer and so today is getting a
compiler-generated _constructor_ which doesn't support copy
initialization.  The theory is that once the compiler is generating
initializers, all will be better.  That said, I can't seem to get the
test working by providing an explicit initializer either.
