error message: When assigning to a record with multiple 'const' fields, it should be a single error, not one error per field.

The way the error is phrased right now, additional errors after the
first one are an unwelcome repetition.

Even if the error message printed the name of the const field
that causes trouble, I probably would not welcome multiple
error messages per assignment - instead would prefer to
fold the printing of all fields into a single message.
