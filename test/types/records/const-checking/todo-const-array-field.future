bug: const checking is not performed for an array field or a record

Either when it is a 'var' field of a 'const' record,
or when it is a 'const' field of any record.

TODO: check 'const' field of a 'const' record.

TODO: check when it is a class, not a record.
NB accesses to 'var' array fields of a 'const' class-typed variable
are OK, as opposed to records.
