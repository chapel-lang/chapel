bug: When using associative domains and arrays of records with const fields, multiple const-related errors are reported.

For now, the workaround is to avoid making the records' fields 'const'.

Note on .bad: the particular error messages being reported may change
as the compiler progresses. That should be OK, as long as the new error
message(s) are still related to cont-ness - just update .bad.
Ultimately, the program should compile with just the two warnings
and execute successfully.
