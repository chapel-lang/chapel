// sharedRefCount.chpl:14: error: non-lvalue actual is passed to 'ref' formal 'rhs' of = [functionResolution.cpp:2543]
// which means that there is no ref promotion...
// proc =(ref lhs: Handle, rhs:Handle)
// That's where we want to go, but we're not there yet.  Again, since there is
// no ref promotion, we don't bind the lhs either, and end up using the
// catch-all implementation on line 242 of ChapelBase.chpl.
// We have to bind to this version, or we don't get the desired
// reference-counting behavior

  // The handle now copies a reference to its implementation from the RHS.
  // The implementation is of class type, so this is a pointer copy.
