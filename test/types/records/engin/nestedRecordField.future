bug: inner record object as a field

NOTES

- When outer is a record, it is not possible to have a field of the inner record

- Lydia: In the case of nested records, the compiler is unable to create an
  instance of the outer type due to not being able to detect and appropriately
  respond to the interdependency of the inner and outer type when creating their
  default methods, and thus making it unable to determine the return type to
  generate from its default methods
