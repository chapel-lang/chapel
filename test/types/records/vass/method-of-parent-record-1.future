bug: cannot invoke a method that is inherited from the parent record

Note: this test assumes that we want to have record inheritance.
See also:

  test/classes/hilde/recordInheritance.chpl

Currently this test fails with an internal error upon --verify,
or fails during C compilation without --verify.
When this .future is retired, --verify can/should be removed from .compopts.

Earlier notes:

a.test() works fine, but b.test() causes compiler error (which it shouldn't):

method-of-parent-record-1.chpl:10: error: actual formal type mismatch
