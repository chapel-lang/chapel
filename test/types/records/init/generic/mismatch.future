error message: confusing error for mismatched generic type assignment

This test is complaining about an unresolved call to an initializer
that we're arguably not making.  Compiling in developer mode, it seems
to be coming from one of our compiler-generated `defaultOf()` calls.
But why should we be calling `defaultOf()` for a case that has an
explicit initializer.  Are we still double-initializing?
