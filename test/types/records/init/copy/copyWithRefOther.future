feature request: copy initializers taking 'ref' arguments
#8234

At present, if a copy initializer takes a 'ref' argument, the
internal/compiler-generated code (chpl__initCopy/autoCopy) that wraps
it breaks compilation because they do not use `ref` intents, so don't
have a legal l-value to pass along to the user's copy initializer.  I
ran into this case while working on converting the OwnedObject module
over to use initializers.  At present, its type has special
init/autoCopy routines that explicitly take and propagate 'ref's.

While we could continue to lean on those special routines to keep this
code working in the initializer world (and could rationalize it by
arguing that they are likely to become part of the "language" rather
than merely another library that a user could write), it also feels
like one of those "if we want to do it, someday a user will want to,
too" cases, so perhaps we should just support it.  Michael suggests
that he thinks it isn't difficult if we decide this is something to
support (so may have pointers for anyone implementing this issue)

Even if we choose not to support it, we would need to come up with a
better error message than the current one, which doesn't make it very
clear to an end-user why their code isn't working.

Note that while this future doesn't refer to a compiler-generated
init/autoCopy routine, those routines are (currently) created by the
compiler for the Owned type due (I believe) to the presence of one of
the pragmas on those types:

    pragma "no copy"
    pragma "copy mutates"
