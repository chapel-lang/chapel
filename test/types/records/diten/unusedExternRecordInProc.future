bug: extern record declared in unused procedure causes internal compiler error

Investigating it 2/3/17:

* proc foo() is removed by "fn->defPoint->remove()" in removeUnusedFunctions()

* The type `timeval` gets removed in the process

* The type `_ref(timeval)`, however, sticks around. Its `_val` field still has the type `timeval`.

* `timeval` is still accessed as `_val` field's type during resolveIntents() - after it is cleaned up at end of resolve(). valgrind flags this access.
