bug: remote records pass by blank intent are shallow-copied.

The record 'x' in 'bar' exists on the last locale in the Locales array.
However, its member 'data' still points to data on the root locale.
Arrays in an aggregate type are assumed to be local to the parent type, and
when possible the local field optimization is applied.

This test will pass if 'x' has the 'const ref' intent.

The spec also suggests that no copies of 'a' should be made.
