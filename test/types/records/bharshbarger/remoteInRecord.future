bug: remote records pass by 'in' intent made local before copying.

This test fails in an initCopy for the 'foo' record. It fails because the
local field optimization is applied to the 'data' member of 'x'. The
optimization is applied because 'x' is narrow, and the compiler assumes that
arrays in an aggregate type will be local to the containing type.

'x' is not wide because we make a local, shallow copy of 'a' before passing 'x'
into 'bar'.

As of this commit, the initCopy is the first thing to happen in 'bar'.
