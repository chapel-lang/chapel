bug: Name lookup during resolution is incorrect

The visibility of function names during resolution is different from that used in the
scopeResolve pass, and also does not provide the behavior outlined in the specification.

In the test case, the constructor for the user's definition of range should be called in
preference to the range constructor in ChapelRange.chpl.  That means that the type of r
should be the user's version of range, and the output should be a representation of a
range within a record, not just a bare range.
