bug: Records (and probably classes) with fields that are distributions do not always work.

I haven't fully pounded out what it takes to get distributions to
behave like arrays and domains (first class values), but it seems that
they will probably have runtime types.  There is specialized code to
"process syntactic distribution" as it was first implemented, and
likely this and the module code will be need to be updated.
