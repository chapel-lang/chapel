semantic: preserve bool widths

It seems as though, for non-default bool widths to be useful, we
should preserve their widths within operators much as we do for small
integers.  It doesn't seem like this would be hard to implement, but I
just ran into it in my previous commit, so wanted to commit a future
against it.
