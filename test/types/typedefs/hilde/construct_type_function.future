feature request: Allow the type returned from a type function to be used in a "new" statement.

Given Chapel's support of type functions, it seems natural to be able to
construct an object based on the type returned from such a function.

I think most of the mechanism for this is in place, but at least the semantic
check in checkPrimNew() in the checkNormalized pass must be modified to also
accept type functions as specifying a type.
