unimplemented feature: Separate compilation does not work for functions with array arguments.

Array types can't be fully-specified by the user, which makes separately compiling a function that takes them as formal arguments impossible.

Separate compilation of functions with array-type arguments has not been implemented.
The compiler does unnatural things to get array types to compile these days.
It needs a genuine array type, so it doesn't have to put weird stand-ins in the
tree.  The stand-in now is chpl__buildArrayRuntimeType, which is converted into
a simple (generic) _array type in normalize.cpp (fixup_array_formals()), and
then a "where" clause is added to encapsulate the array element type.

This is inconsistent and fragile.  The current case in point.
