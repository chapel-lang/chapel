error message: avoid term 'lvalue' in error messages

The term 'lvalue', while reasonably widely known, is not as intuitive
and approachable as I think we'd like our error messages to be.  To
that end, this future asks for a kinder, gentler error message for
cases like this.  The proposed message in the .good file is just a
placeholder/proposal.  Others would be acceptable as well.

Note that there are probably other contexts in which the compiler uses
'lvalue' in its error messages as well... I didn't go looking for
them.
