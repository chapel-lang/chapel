bug: ref variable of an array element does not alias

Seems like in the following:

  ref refArr = myArr[i];

'refArr' works properly as an alias when it is later used as an lvalue.

It does not work properly, i.e. an update to myArr[i] is not visible
through refArr, when refArr is not used as an lvalue.
