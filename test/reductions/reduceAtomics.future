feature request: Support reductions on arrays of atomics

It seems that we should support reductions on arrays of atomics, yet
today we don't.  Here, I focus on + reductions and atomic ints, but I
think we should have a general solution for all cases.  The commented
out code demonstrates overloads that will make this program work as
intended if I uncomment it.  But I don't think I should have to write
it and wouldn't expect most users to figure out how to do it.
