bug: user defined reduction accumulate() with tuple arg fails to resolve

The issue seems to be related to a bad interaction between tuples and
references. Specifically, the compiler is passing a ref-to-eltType into the
routine as the first tuple element, but due to the way tuples are handled, it
doesn't seem to be resolving to the routine that simply wants an eltType as its
first tuple element (and we don't have a way to declare that it should be
ref-to-eltType, nor am I certain we would want to).
