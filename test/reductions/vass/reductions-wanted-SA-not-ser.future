feature request: invoke standalone iterator, not serial

Since #3375 aka eefbfe1, certain reductions are represented in the
compiler using forall loops. Some reductions, however, are represented
as before. That previous representation does not know about
standalone iterators and so invokes only either leader/follower
if they exist or serial iterator otherwise. While we can fix that
representation to allow for standalone iterators too, our path
forward is to use the new representation for all reductions.
This future commemorates our intention to do so.

This future exercises the case where both a standalone iterator is
available, as well as the serial iterator but not leader/follower.
If so, we would like the standalone iterator to be invoked, whereas
currently the serial iterator is.
