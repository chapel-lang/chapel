bug: Const checking on the index var of standalone iters is broken.

Const checking _does_ work when the standalone iter is invoked through a `for`
loop by tag. That's probably because it's just a normal for loop at resolution
time when the const error would be reported and it's only during LowerIterators
that the standalone iterator is inlined.
