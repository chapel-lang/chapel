feature request: Allow the index variable to have a specified type

Currently if you want the index variable to be a different size you need to cast an
element of the range to be of that type, e.g:
	for i in 1..10:int(8) do
		foo(i);
This is slightly unintuitive, allowing the user to specify the type via
	for i:int(8) in 1..10 do
		foo(i);
demonstrates a clearer intent as to what the user is trying to achieve.
