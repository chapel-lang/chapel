bug: incorrect use-before-def error due to if-throw-else-don't pattern
#15691

This program demonstrates that when we have a conditional that throws
along one branch and not the other, we sometimes get an incorrect
use-before-def error.  If `return testit2(dom);` is changed to `return
dom;` things work; as does adding a dummy assignment to the throwing
branch of the conditional.
