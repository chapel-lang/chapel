# USAGE:
#
# Current notes on triage results, sorted into the following categories:
#
# * cases that are assigned and should be fixed (ideally during the coming
#   week)
#
# * cases that are causing noise regularly in testing, sorted by
#   approximate priority
#
# * cases that were once flagged as causing regular noise, but don't seem
#   so bad currently
#
# * cases that are not familiar, but have caused noise -- these are
#   noted so that if they happen again, we can move them up to an
#   earlier session and recognize a slower pattern over a longer
#   period of time
#
# * regular failures that someone might look at as part of their triage week
#
# The path to each test with intermittent behavior should appear here, so
# it can be grepped for. Except if a lot of test fail for the identical
# reason or in the same directory, a wildcard is more appropriate.
# The convention here is to include just the path, without test/ or .chpl.
# The date of the most recent note is also useful, with "ongoing"
# if appropriate.

Non-deterministic baseline 'glibc double free or corruption' (6/17/14, 6/23/14)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This i also listed in the REGRESSIONS file, but I'm not sure when it
started being intermittent.
[Error matching program output for release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/hpl]

cray-xe.cray-prgenv-cray.none.fifo.flat--linux64.gnu
----------------------------------------------------

This test is missing some whitespace in the output. First failure occurred
2014-06-07.

[Error matching program output for functions/deitz/iterators/test_instantiate_iterator3a]

These all timed out on 2014-06-07 on chpbld02. The cray PrgEnv is notoriously
slow, and it's possible the box was extra busy doing something else (like
installing automatic updates).

darwin-gnu and darwin-clang non-deterministic compiler failures
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are a few classes of these failures during compilation that seem
to be non-deterministic based on only 2 nights of testing.  The most
common is an internal error and the next most common was an 'invalid
where clause' error.  The others only had 1-2 instances.  In order of
number of occurrences:

- error: internal failure MIS0355 chpl Version 1.8.0.-999
- invalid where clause
- compiler seg fault
- timedexec: target program died with signal 10, without coredump
- error: Initializing parameter 'ret' to value not known at compile time
- error: unresolved call '_if_fn7()'
- resolution error (unresolved call '_fill(int(64), 2*int(64))')
- warning: whole array assignment has been serialized
- error: internal failure EXP3124 chpl Version 1.8.0.-999
- error: internal failure EXP0244 chpl Version 1.8.0.-999

Update 05/30/14:
- Taking a closer look at the compiler segfaults (MIS0355) for darwin-clang:
  They seem to happen for any test program if run for enough iterations. Fails
  roughly once every ~250 compiles, but does not fail under gdb (at least not
  after ~20,000 compiles.) Could be because address space randomization is
  turned off with gdb for osx.

  Tried to debug with a core dump, but core dumps don't work with gdb on osx
  (at least when clang is the compiler) so had to debug with lldb. Segfault
  appears in compiler/AST/expr.cpp in method SymExpr::codegen() with line ret =
  ret = var->codegen(); (line 298 at r23460)

  That doesn't make a lot of sense so my best guess at this point is a buffer
  overflow at some point. Valgrind turned up clean, although valgrind is
  notoriously unreliable for osx and wouldn't catch a stack overflow anyways.
  (ejr)

gasnet time out (possible gasnet race condition/deadlock)
---------------------------------------------------------

Many tests that clearly do not bump up against the timeout are timing
out.  For example, test/distributions/bradc/blkCyc/weirdcase.chpl.
Timed out for segment everything (12/9/13, 12/13/13), but should run
in ~10s for segment everything.  Similarly,
studies/hpcc/PTRANS/jglewis/ptrans_2011-blkcyc.chpl should run in
about 40 seconds for segment everything but timed out on 1/13/14.

Possible couple recent examples:
[Error: Timed out executing program optimizations/bulkcomm/alberto/Block/perfTest_v2 (compopts: 1)] (02/26/14)
[Error: Timed out executing program optimizations/bulkcomm/alberto/Cyclic/perfTest (compopts: 1)] (03/31/14)

numa testing non-determinism
----------------------------

sungeun: I believe this test pushes the stack size limit and gets
lucky sometimes.  I've left the entry in the REGRESSIONS file for now.
[Error matching program output for release/examples/benchmarks/lulesh/test3DLulesh (compopts: 1, execopts: 3)]

nondet. baseline output
-----------------------
[Error matching program output for studies/amr/diffusion/level/Level_DiffusionBE_driver (compopts: 1)]
11/3/13: has been failing frequently (for --baseline) since 9/28/13
12/29/2013:
gbt: This seems to be due to memory corruption.  Because of the way the
     test post-processes its output it's not obvious, but compiling and
     running it manually I saw this in the output:
       *** glibc detected *** ./Level_DiffusionBE_driver: double free or
       corruption (out): 0x00007f6345179b80 ***
     This results in a SIGABRT (probably caused by calling abort()),
     which kills the program, and this in turn means that the file the
     output postprocessing wants to work on doesn't exist.  A gripe
     about this missing file is the most obvious thing in the output if
     start_test is used.

This may be related to the "XT/XC PrgEnv-cray non-deterministic
compiler internal errors (misc.cpp)" issue below, but one of the
few cases that triggers on the compute node rather than on the
front-end


=========================================================
Problems analyzed and assigned that should be fixed soon:
=========================================================

XT/XC PrgEnv-cray non-deterministic compiler internal errors
(seg fault) this shows up on
cray-x?-cray-prgenv-cray.none.fifo.pthreads runs
------------------------------------------------------------

Determined to be a problem with CCE.  Filed bug 800520.  This bug
probably will not be fixed as it is an issue with static linking on
the login node.  Not worth recording the various failures, but you can
recognize the error in the following manner.  It will be a "Error
matching compiler output" and when you look at the log file, it will
fail with a seg fault which shows up as an internal error in misc.cpp,
so it will say something like "error: internal failure MIS0355 chpl
Version 1.8.0.-999".

pthread mutex lock assertion failed (after 22303, unassigned)

[Error matching program output for parallel/sync/diten/returnSync]
> returnSync_real: pthread_mutex_lock.c:62: __pthread_mutex_lock: Assertion `mutex->__data.__owner == 0' failed.
A brief review of the source code suggests that this problem should not occur 
unless there is a problem with atomic compare-and-swap, or data corruption in 
the mutex.
Can be duplicated with --no-local; valgrind not clean.

overflow error documented in REGRESSIONS)

compflags/ferguson/sub_test
---------------------------
chpbld02 has /tmp mounted on /ptmp.  The path search in findProgramPath appears
to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.

come up again

NOTES: This is a race condition that is present in the case of *all*
iteration of val iterators (e.g. domains) where the index is passed to
a function for promotion.  The reason we don't run into this more
often is because the window for races is typically very small (usually
between 2 lines of the generated code), and it's slightly larger for
--no-local for associative arrays promoted remove().  The index
variable needs to be declared outside the scope of the promoted
function so that it can be referred to.  After the iterators are
lowered, during the parallel pass, coforall blocks are converted to
nested functions that are then flattened.  The index var is an "outer
var" (declared in the outer scope), and thus is is passed by reference
to the newly unnested functions.  But because it is the index
variable, the iterator overwrites it anyways.  In the case of the var
iterator, it simply overwrites the reference with another reference.
In the case of the val iterator, it write the actual value.  Since all
tasks performing the coforall share the same memory location passed in
from the promotion wrapper,

extern_string_test .bad mismatch
--------------------------------
[Error matching .bad file for users/ferguson/extern_string_test (compopts: 1)]
r23337 (5/2/14) adds a prediff to standardize the common output generated
by this future, so the failure to match .bad should be rare.
Note: if the test log just says "files are different", this is perhaps
because the (erroneous) output contains non-printing characters.
