# USAGE:
#
# Current notes on triage results, sorted into the following categories:
#
# * cases that are assigned and should be fixed (ideally during the coming
#   week)
#
# * cases that are causing noise regularly in testing, sorted by
#   approximate priority
#
# * cases that were once flagged as causing regular noise, but don't seem
#   so bad currently
#
# * cases that are not familiar, but have caused noise -- these are
#   noted so that if they happen again, we can move them up to an
#   earlier session and recognize a slower pattern over a longer
#   period of time
#
# * regular failures that someone might look at as part of their triage week
#
# The path to each test with intermittent behavior should appear here, so
# it can be grepped for. Except if a lot of test fail for the identical
# reason or in the same directory, a wildcard is more appropriate.
# The convention here is to include just the path, without test/ or .chpl.
# The date of the most recent note is also useful, with "ongoing"
# if appropriate.

gbt, 04-26-13: r21322 broke parallel/taskPool/figueroa/TooManyThreads.
               I fixed this in r21327, but it may show up as a Resolved
               Error for a few days more.


==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:

compflags/diten/noInlineAndHtml (future)
----------------------------------------
Sometimes this segfaults the compiler and sometimes it doesn't.  We
haven't yet figured what differentiates encountering it vs. not, so
we haven't been able to constrain it to only run when it will fail.


linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
NOTE: These seem to happen on program exit, as the rest of the output
is correct.
- release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/stream-ep (04/04/13)
- release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/ra-atomics (compopts: 1) (3/11/13)

- distributions/bradc/blkCyc/loopBlkCyc (4/9/13, maybe same as next?)

gbt: 4/26/13: Committed stack overflow detection in qthreads based on
guard pages.  By default it is turned on.  Hopefully this will result in
dependable failures, based on which we can figure out where to set the
default stack size.  (Note that the current default is 256 KiB.)

bradc: (3/2/13, 3/27/13): distributions/bradc/blkCyc/loopBlkCyc got a seg fault

bradc: week of 2/25: continue getting noise, particularly on
test_many_domains, streap-ep, jacobi; sometimes timeouts, sometimes
seg faults (stream-ep, e.g.)

gbt: 1/14/13.  Here the list of failure counts for the last 7 days.
(Thank you, grep|cut|sed|sort|uniq!)  I've sent this to Kyle and
Dylan.  76 of these are with comm=none, and 28 with comm=gasnet.

sungeun: 12/7/12.  Enabled oversubscription (and disable affinity).
Dylan says that in this configuration the timeouts all passed.  It's
possible that some of these other failures might be due to callstack
size.

sungeun: 10/18/12.  Things seem quieter, but not perfect
- Got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16, stream-ep 8/23/12, 02/28/13)
- Intermitent seg fault on exit (7/7 7/9, 7/12, 7/13)
-  seg fault during program execution (same as as previous):
   distributions/robust/arithmetic/optimizations/optimizeOnClauses_basic_tuple (7/10)
   release/examples/spec/Classes/delete (7/12)
- Intermitent time outs:
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/slicing/test_array_slicing3] (intermittent since prior to 11/25/12)
  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi] (11/26/12: intermittent since 9/17/12)

  [Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl (compopts: 1)] (11/28/12: likely earlier as well)


==============================================================================
Were once flagged as causing noise regularly, but not as familiar as the above
==============================================================================

SSCA2_main (UNASSIGNED)
-----------------------
Periodically times out for PGI (alternates between time out and stack
overflow error documented in REGRESSIONS)


TooManyThreads (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------
Fails periodically.  Lately observed pthreads.tcmalloc (2012/08/15).


compflags/ferguson/sub_test
---------------------------
chpbld02 has /tmp mounted on /ptmp.  The path search in findProgramPath appears
to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.


==========================================================================
Not so noisy as to be familiar annoyances, but worth noting to see if they
come up again
==========================================================================

undiagnosed cygwin failures
---------------------------

intermittent valgrind error
---------------------------
- studies/madness/aniruddha/madchap/mytests/par-compress/test_compress
(compopts: 1) (02/26/13)

- studies/madness/aniruddha/madchap/mytests/par-refine/test_refine (compopts: 1)
Got wrong answer for F3.norm2() on 10/29/12, 01/14/13.
As of 2/4/2013, those are the only times the test ran with compopts: 1.
The other times it ran without compopts:1 and succeeded.
- studies/madness/aniruddha/madchap/mytests/par-reconstruct/test_reconstruct
Various numeric discrepancies, first occurred on 9/15/2012 or before.
- release/examples/primers/chpldoc (compopts: 1)  (8/28/2012, 9/07/2012, 9/11/2012, 02/25/13)
This is not a problem with chpldocs (should file a separate future).
There is an intermittent compile-time segfault during cullOverReferences.
The type of Bar.super is at least partially corrupt at that point.

----------------------------------------
(week of 07/02, still present 10/2, 10/9/12, 1/6/13, 2/1/13)

NOTES: This is a race condition that is present in the case of *all*
iteration of val iterators (e.g. domains) where the index is passed to
a function for promotion.  The reason we don't run into this more
often is because the window for races is typically very small (usually
between 2 lines of the generated code), and it's slightly larger for
--no-local for associative arrays promoted remove().  The index
variable needs to be declared outside the scope of the promoted
function so that it can be referred to.  After the iterators are
lowered, during the parallel pass, coforall blocks are converted to
nested functions that are then flattened.  The index var is an "outer
var" (declared in the outer scope), and thus is is passed by reference
to the newly unnested functions.  But because it is the index
variable, the iterator overwrites it anyways.  In the case of the var
iterator, it simply overwrites the reference with another reference.
In the case of the val iterator, it write the actual value.  Since all
tasks performing the coforall share the same memory location passed in
from the promotion wrapper,

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.
