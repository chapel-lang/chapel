# USAGE:
#
# Current notes on triage results, sorted into the following categories:
#
# * cases that are assigned and should be fixed (ideally during the coming
#   week)
#
# * cases that are causing noise regularly in testing, sorted by
#   approximate priority
#
# * cases that were once flagged as causing regular noise, but don't seem
#   so bad currently
#
# * cases that are not familiar, but have caused noise -- these are
#   noted so that if they happen again, we can move them up to an
#   earlier session and recognize a slower pattern over a longer
#   period of time
#
# * regular failures that someone might look at as part of their triage week
#
# The path to each test with intermittent behavior should appear here, so
# it can be grepped for. Except if a lot of test fail for the identical
# reason or in the same directory, a wildcard is more appropriate.
# The convention here is to include just the path, without test/ or .chpl.
# The date of the most recent note is also useful, with "ongoing"
# if appropriate.

Segfaults in tests (eronagha 7/25/13 and continuing, due to r21614):

Elliot is working on these.


XT PrgEnv-cray non-deterministic compiler internal errors (eronagha
7/20/13): These started showing up after Elliot's commit on both
chpbld01 and chpbld02.  I didn't see anything about a major update to
CCE or the front-end, but I guess it's still possible that this could
be a CCE issue.
- gbt: The MIS0324 errors occurred on 7/22, 7/23, 7/25, 7/26.


ft-serial performance tests either time out or run out of memory:
(lydia 7/22/13): Class C & D seem to run out of memory when the don't
time out first.


Future (bug: this idiom generates a gcc warning for some reason (error
w/ -Werror)) [Success matching program output for
studies/shootout/mandelbrot/bugs/mandelbrot-error] (bradc 7/19/13):
Brad's r21590 will hopefully take care of the remaining passing
futures (i.e.,last week's weekend XT testing runs).


cray-prgenv-* (weekday) (sungeun 6/5/13, diten 6/21/13):
This causes frequent problems as some components get updated on chpbld01, but
not others.  It is currently running successfully.  We should consider making
chplbld01 and chpbld02 behave similarly.  According to Ryan, chplbld01 is
being treated like an XT white box (at our request?).  There are no longer XT
PE updates, and this may cause periodic module woes.


==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:

linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (sungeun)
------------------------------------------
7/16/13: I moved qthreads testing to chap05, and most of these
timeouts were resolved, minus test_many_domains.

Our main noisy failures currently are as follows:

  distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_array
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_domains


After moving these tests to a slower machine (chap02->chap10) several more
timed out including the three above plus:

  distributions/jglewis/cyclicOnEvenNumLocales.chpl
  distributions/bradc/extremeBlock.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/basics/test_array_of_distributed_array2.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/slicing/test_array_slicing3.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Sort.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Norm.chpl
  distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/hpl (compopts: 1).chpl
  distributions/dm/t8.chpl


I don't know that it's worth tracking when these pass fail currently.
Greg looked into the execution times and found that the problem is
that their execution time is very close to the timeout and
significantly longer than fifo.  Dylan and Brad looked into the cause
and narrowed it down to privatization (e.g., if all lines other than
the domain declarations are removed from test_many_domains, the
execution time is still very high and close to the timeout), but have
not yet gotten further than that to determine what the problem is --
e.g., a busy-wait loop, excess communication, slow handling of active
messages due to not having a thread per task as in fifo, or ...?

I've deleted historical notes on this entry that seem less useful
at present.  See the archives for more detail.

to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.

NOTES: This is a race condition that is present in the case of *all*
iteration of val iterators (e.g. domains) where the index is passed to
a function for promotion.  The reason we don't run into this more
often is because the window for races is typically very small (usually
between 2 lines of the generated code), and it's slightly larger for
--no-local for associative arrays promoted remove().  The index
variable needs to be declared outside the scope of the promoted
function so that it can be referred to.  After the iterators are
lowered, during the parallel pass, coforall blocks are converted to
nested functions that are then flattened.  The index var is an "outer
var" (declared in the outer scope), and thus is is passed by reference
to the newly unnested functions.  But because it is the index
variable, the iterator overwrites it anyways.  In the case of the var
iterator, it simply overwrites the reference with another reference.
In the case of the val iterator, it write the actual value.  Since all
tasks performing the coforall share the same memory location passed in
from the promotion wrapper,

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.
