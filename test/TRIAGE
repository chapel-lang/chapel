2012-09-19 stack overflow on SSCA2
  No clue.

2012-09-18 gasnet testing failures.  raCommCheck and kin.
  Due to zippered iteration syntax change not propagating to parallel-only tests.
  John's sieve was to actually run the tests and fix failures rather than to 
    identify a standard syntax pattern to use in a global search.
  John submitted a patch and this issue is resolved.

2012-09-17 qthreads build failure.
  Due to LLVM backend checkin.
  Michael was alerted and submitted a patch for review.
  Brad is responding to Michael -- perhaps suggesting a less invasive solution.

==============================================
These things regularly cause noise in testing:
==============================================

spectralnorm
------------
Removed from further consideration <hilde 2012-09-20>

proposed approach is to see whether reference version is similarly
noisy, and if not to see whether ours has inadvertant nondeterminisms.
(still noisy as of 2012/08/14-8/24: gnfp, gnfp-nolocal)

8/31/12: This is still causing regular failures.  Tom came up with
some way tot rewrite the algorithm to maybe help (?) but neither he
nor Vass know whether this violates the definition of the benchmark.

madness (sungeun)
-----------------
Sung's been working on dialing down parallelism to avoid timeouts
in oversubscribed setting, but it's not yet perfect: test_likepy
timed out 06/05/12.
- Added a .timeout file for test_likepy (sungeun: 8/29/2012)

ra* (gbt)
---------
Greg committed a fix to resolve the race in the main version (r20301),
and now just needs to propagate it to the other versions, as well as
to the else-clause of the 'useOn' conditional.
  release/examples/benchmarks/hpcc/variants/ra-cleanloop: fixed by r20326
  studies/hpcc/2008/ra: not fixed yet, failed 8/14/12
  studies/hpcc/nodistrib/ra.nodist: not fixed yet, failed 8/14/12, still failing 2012/09/21.
  studies/hpcc/RA/bradc/parallel/ra-dist: not fixed yet, last failure unknown


lulesh (bradc)
--------------
Times out sometimes in XMT testing, but seems to have stabilized in
other cases.


TooManyThreads (unassigned)
---------------------------
Fails periodically.  Lately observed pthreads.tcmalloc (2012/08/15).


mutilocale/deitz/needMultiLocales/diagnostics/test_private_broadcast_large
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Succeeded: 9/23 (64ggffpd)

parallel/sync/diten/syncArrOfSync (future)
---------------------------------
  Succeeded: 9/23 (64ggffpd)

linux64.gnu.gasnet.qthreads.none (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------------------------------
0) We moved to a non-oversubscribed setting on a beefier machine
1) Continue to have a lot of noise in testing.
   - Often the execution times out nondeterministically
2) Got a seg fault (06/06/12, 6/16, stream-ep 8/23/12)
3) Intermitent seg fault on exit (7/7 7/9, 7/12, 7/13, same as #2?)
4) seg fault during program execution (same as #2?):
   distributions/robust/arithmetic/optimizations/optimizeOnClauses_basic_tuple (7/10)
   release/examples/spec/Classes/delete (7/12)


baseline (UNASSIGNED)
---------------------
distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales
studies/hpcc/HPL/vass/bl.md
studies/shootout/mandelbrot/mandelbrot-fancy


valgrind (sungeun)
------------------
*** It's a little difficult to follow the trend since we only run this
*** once a week, so only the last log file is preserved.  We should
*** considering saving the logs week-over-week (which we should
*** probably do for all the tests too since we have the space to).
1) Nondeterministic "the impossible has happened" failures
   2012/08/13 -- Only one test case failed: MultiBlockDist2DLocales

   8/30/12: Passed --numThreadsPerLocale=100 to all tests to try and
   avoid VG_N_THREADS error that is causing all the impossible errors.

2) Nondeterministic timeouts (could raise timeout value even further)
   8/30/12: Timed out when running start_test by hand (versus in
   parallel as the nightly does), so I don't think it's worth
   disabling parallel testing for the sake of the time outs.



xmt build (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------
Every night, first XMT compile fails; second one succeeds.  Is there
any chance that this is due to a leftover program library of some
sort?  If not, file bug against XMT compiler.

compflags/ferguson/sub_test
---------------------------
chpbld02 has /tmp mounted on /ptmp.  The path search in findProgramPath appears
to be finding chpl in /ptmp instead of /tmp even though the /ptmp directory
it is finding is not in path. The /ptmp path it is finding is actually the
same directory as the /tmp directory it is looking for.

=========================================
Not so noisy as to be familiar annoyances
=========================================

parallel/cobegin/diten/cobeginRace (UNASSIGNED)
----------------------------------------------------
"timedexec died with signal 11" - pgi compiler (06/18/12)
unknown cause - baseline (06/17/12)

examples of what times out:
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/kernels/jacobi (still timing out 7/7-8/13)
 distributions/nelson/MultiBlockDist2DLocales (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetic/modules/test_module_Sort (maybe resolved?)
 distributions/robust/arithmetci/stress/test_many_domains (08/13)

nondet. tmalloc failures
------------------------
[Error: Timed out executing program distributions/robust/arithmetic/stress/test_many_domains] (08/08/12)

parallel/begin/deitz/test_big_recursive_begin future succeeded
--------------------------------------------------------------
only in these two runs:
 120818/Nightly-day6-Sat-linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads-std.log
 120821/Nightly-day2-Tue-linux64.gnu.none.fifo.pthreads-nlc.log

===========================================
Not noisy, but need some attention sometime
===========================================

types/range/hilde/align64
-------------------------
This test gets a false positive pass on intel and pgi it seems, for
reasons that are not clear to me (i.e., why are they behaving differently
than gcc?).  If the future should remain, a .skipif should be added to
skip it in these cases.
 
I wouldn't call the future a bug so much as a 'feature request' or
'semantic' future -- it suggests a change in the language definition
that should be considered and agreed upon rather than reflecting a way
in which the compiler is incorrect w.r.t. the language definition (as
I understand it.
