feature request: error when calling function that returns a type not named in only list

At the moment, when a type is not in your 'only' list you can't name it, but you
can call a function in your 'only' list that returns a value of that type.  You
won't get an error for doing this until you try to access a method on that type
whose name also wasn't in the 'only' list.  I think the correct behavior is to
warn/error when calling a function which gives you a type you can't otherwise
obtain, especially since I think that naming a type in your 'only' list should
bring in all the methods and fields that would be visible to you.
