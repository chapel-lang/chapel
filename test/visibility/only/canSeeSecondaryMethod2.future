feature request: ability to specify secondary methods defined in other modules in 'only' list

If a secondary method on a type is defined in a module other than the one which
contains the original type definition, currently there isn't a good way to
specify that you only wish to include that method.  Creating an 'except' list
that includes everything but that method is unwieldy if the module is of
significant size.  Similarly, if you wished to avoid secondary methods defined
in that module, creating an 'only' list that listed everything but those methods
is also unwieldy.  I think the obvious choice would be to name in the
'except'/'only' list the type on which these methods are defined.
