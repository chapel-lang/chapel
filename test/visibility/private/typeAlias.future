unimplemented feature: allow private type aliases

Right now, public and private can't be applied to type aliases.  We would like
to be able to do that, and catch any outside use of publicly visible instances
of the private type.  When we can apply private to type alias definitions,
please add additional tests to be certain we catch those cases.
