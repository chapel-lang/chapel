unimplemented feature: allow private enum declarations

Right now, public and private can't be applied to enum declarations.  We would
like to be able to do that, and catch any outside use of publicly visible
instances of the private enum type.  When we can apply private to enum
declarations, please add additional tests to be certain we catch those cases.
