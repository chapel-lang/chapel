feature request: error when calling function that returns a type named in except list

Right now, though any plain accesses of a type named in the 'except' list will
fail to resolve, we can still make calls to functions that return that type
and thus get an instance of it.  Maybe that's okay, a way to specify that the
'foo' you most care about is someone else's 'foo' but that this one still has
its uses?  In any case, I'd like to detect when this happens and possibly emit
a warning, but right now that would likely involve dismantling a larger portion
of functionResolution than I want to touch right now.
