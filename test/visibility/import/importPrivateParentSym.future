bug: import of a private symbol in a parent module fails

This shows a bug in which a child module cannot refer to a private
symbol in its parent module.  On master today, the child module can
simply name the parent module's symbol, so it seems it should be able
to import it as well.  In the planned changes when a child module will
have to import its parent to refer to its symbols, I suspect that
we'll still want an import to be able to refer to that symbol by name.
