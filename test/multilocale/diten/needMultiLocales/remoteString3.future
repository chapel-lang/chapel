bug: multi-locale strings assigned by reference

Was:

bug: string variable should stay on the locale it was declared on

In this code, the assignment to s in the on statement makes s migrate to
Locale(1).  The string should logically remain on Locale(0) throughout
its lifetime.

Note that, as of commit 2cce3f9d40e6349cc69dfd46ddf4e3ddf3fe4f34 (Oct
3, 2014), this test has started working with gasnet-fast, but not
gasnet-everything.

When this future is retired, remoteString3.skipif should be removed
and remoteString3-fast.* should be retired.
