bug: string:string cast within on-clause gives follower error

While this pattern isn't particularly interesting or useful as written
here, it seems that it ought to be legal, yet it gives an error:
"follower iterators accepting a non-POD argument by in-intent are not
implemented".  The pattern is more interesting/useful in the context
of a generic function where you want to cast an incoming argument to
'x' regardless of its type and want it to also work with strings.
