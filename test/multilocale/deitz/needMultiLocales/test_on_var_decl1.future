multilocale: var declaration in on statement

Make sure that on-statements do not open new scopes.
  What about on-blocks?

Make sure that variables declared in on-statements are accessed via a
reference.

This is related to the global variables work and maybe a good first
step, though it can also be implemnted orthongonally.
