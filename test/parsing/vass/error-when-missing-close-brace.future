error message: more specific error message upon missing close brace

Right now I get
  foo.chpl:NNNN: syntax error
where NNNN points to the last line in the file plus one and there is no
indication what cased the error. Pointing to the location of the offending
open brace would reduce the time the user needs to fix the source code.
