error message: when a string literal contains a backslash+char combo not supported in C

We need to decide whether \w in a string literal is allowed and simply
stands for 'w' or we follow C and disallow it.
(This should also be documented in the spec.)
If the latter, the Chapel compiler should generate a clear message
about the violation.

As of this writing, Chapel is diverging from C in the handling of newlines
in string literals (see the commit message around r19228).
We probably want to be either as close to C as possible or something
altogether different.

What are string literals like in Fortran?
