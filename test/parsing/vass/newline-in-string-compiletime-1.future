bug: newlines and double quotes are not displayed properly in compilerWarning/compilerError messages

The compiler prints out the arguments to compilerWarning/compilerError
the way they are stored in the internal representation. However,
the internal representation needs to be post-processed, e.g. \n
should be converted to newline. (See also the commit message around r19228.)
