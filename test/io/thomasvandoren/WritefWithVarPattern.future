bug: writef fails to resolve when first argument is var string instead of string literal

This example highlights the issue:

var outPattern = "%s\n";
writef(outPattern, "i can haz format?");

The compiler is unable to resolve writef. The canditate includes these options,
which are fairly close to 'writef(string, "i can haz format?")':

channel.writef(fmt: string, args ...?k)
channel.writef(fmt: c_string, args ...?k)
writef(fmt: c_string, args ...?k)

However, it is notable that writef(fmt: string, args ...?k) is missing from the
candidate list.
