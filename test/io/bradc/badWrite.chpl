// was written to make sure a string length was not written at the beginning
// of the string.
//
// Now that we have Serializers and more direct ways to write binary data, this
// test exists to demonstrate the *difference* between 'write' and 'writef'.
//
// By default, the BinarySerializer is expected to emit a length before the
// string.
