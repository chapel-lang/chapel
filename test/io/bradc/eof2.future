feature request: eof on QIO channels

Michael argued reasonably that eof is an inherently problematic
routine in the case of dynamic streams of data and that it's no longer
strictly necessary since the new read routines generate errors that
permit one to test for eof without halting the program.  But even so,
it seems attractive to me to provide an eof for the simple case of
reading data from a static file until it's all gone, or at least
comfort, so I'm filing this as a placeholder.  And possibly for the
read(type t) form of reads in which the return code can't be used to
indicate eof.
