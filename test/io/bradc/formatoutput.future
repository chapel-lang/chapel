feature request: output formatting

This future is a placeholder for implementing some sort of
formatting when writing integer and floating point values.
I'm not married to (nor particularly fond of) the syntax
that I used here, but wanted to have something as a placeholder.
Generally, I like the concept of casting to strings, but am not
as crazy about %format strings (in part because we don't have
as much need of them as C does, since we have better information
about our types being written; in part because I think the C
flags are unintuitive.

The person who takes this on should probably start by seeing
what C# and Java do, and then see if they can fit that into
a Chapel type cast framework.
