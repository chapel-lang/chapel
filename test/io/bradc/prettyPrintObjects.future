feature request: pretty printing of objects

When debugging large classes/records lately (like array/domain
implementing classes) I found myself wishing I had some means
of pretty printing them in an indented style as in gdb.  This
test captures the flavor of that even though the case is not
as compelling.  This could be through a global config param (or 
one that could be overridden on a class-by-class basis) for instance.
