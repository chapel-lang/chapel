bug: Early exit from function with out arg that uses a file reader causes seg fault when not in developer mode

This is a memory management bug that has been tracked into our callDestructors
pass.  With CHPL_DEVELOPER=false or --no-devel thrown, if an out argument was
assigned to before exiting the function then destructor calls for the channel
and file were always inserted before the function returned, even though in the
early exit case the channel and file in question were (to the user's
perspective) not even in existence.  Thus, when they were destroyed, the program
would segfault.

This behavior does not occur with --devel, nor with only a channel writer,
nor with returning a value via a return statement (instead of an out argument).
However, with --devel a channel writer will fail with the same behavior.

Upon resolution of this future, please add a compopts file to test both --devel
and --no-devel mode.

Tom's AMM branch does not exhibit this behavior, so when that gets merged into
trunk, this future should be resolved.
