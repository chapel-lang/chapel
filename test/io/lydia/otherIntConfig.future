feature request: Allow integers of alternate number systems as config values

The user should be able to send an octal, binary, or hexadecimal argument to a
Chapel program.  The motivating cases are test/io/lydia/mkdir/makeWithMode.chpl
and test/io/lydia/chmod/changeMode.chpl - I have a branch, octalArgs, on my fork
to modify these tests that should be merged when this future is resolved.  At
the moment, attempting to do so will generate an error in converting the string
to an integer.  This is most likely the place to start when implementing this
feature.

Since I can't use multiple .bad files (and I don't think implementing that
capability in start_test is worth my time right now), I will put the error
messages here:

<command line setting of 'foo'>: error: Unexpected character when converting from string to int(64): 'o'

<command line setting of 'baz'>: error: Unexpected character when converting from string to int(64): 'b'

<command line setting of 'bar'>: error: Unexpected character when converting from string to int(64): 'x'
