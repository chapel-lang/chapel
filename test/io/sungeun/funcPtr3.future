bug: writeln() called with a writeln as an argument leads to unexpected output.

This test currently fails compilation with the following message:

   funcPtr3.chpl:1: error: 'writeln' undeclared (first use this function)

It should probably be illegal and give the same compile-time error as
the other funcPtr*.chpl programs.
