DE
GUICHE:
[looking
at
the
house]
I
cannot
see
well
at
all
through
this
mask!
[He
is
about
to
enter,
when
CYRANO
leaps
from
the
balcony,
holding
onto
the
branch,
which
bends,
dropping
him
between
the
door
and
DE
GUICHE.
He
then
pretends
to
fall
heavily,
as
if
from
a
great
height,
and
lies
flat
on
the
ground,
motionless,
as
if
stunned.
DE
GUICHE
jumps
back,
startled.]
What's
this?
[When
he
looks
up,
the
branch
has
sprung
back
into
its
place.
He
sees
only
the
sky,
and
is
lost
in
amazement.]
Where
did
this
man
fall
from?
CYRANO:
[sitting
up
and
speaking
with
a
thick
Gascon
accent]
From
the
moon!
