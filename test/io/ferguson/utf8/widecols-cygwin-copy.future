bug: Certain utf8 characters miscount their width on cygwin

On Linux, the character G Clef takes up one character width,
while cygwin thinks it takes up two when determining how to
fill a line, making the output line which includes it
shorter than it would be if the length was counted correctly.

This test is a symlink to the original, widecols.chpl.  Once
this future has been resolved, remove this test and the
skipif for widecols on cygwin.
