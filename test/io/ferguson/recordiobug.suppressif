# I think that these are Intel compiler bugs
#
# The bug seems related to the Intel failures we used to see
# with writefbinary.chpl. TMac investigated them a little bit
# but I'm having trouble figuring out exactly how it concluded.
# I think that we just upgraded the Intel compiler and the error went
# away.
#
# Here is the evidence that it is an Intel compiler bug:
#
# * other compilers run these tests correctly
# * valgrind is clean with gcc, with intel it warns about
#  reading beyond an allocated region in a strlen() call.
#  (I do not think that is related to the bug)
# * The problem goes away with -g
# * The problem goes away with --ccflags -O0
# * The problem goes away if I add a printf in readIt
#  in the generated code
# * The problem goes away if I put qio_channel_read_amt
#  in the runtime library (where it can't be inlined)
#  vs its current location in a header file
# * The problem goes away if I remove restrict from the ptr
#  argument to qio_channel_read_int64
