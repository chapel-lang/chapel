The small C tests in this directory help us
to understand if C-level
 pwrite/pread or
 pwritev/preadv
are working and if the sys.c functions implementing
these for portability are working.

At least some of the 32-bit Linux regressions
for regular expression tests are due to failures
in preadv or pwritev on our system.
