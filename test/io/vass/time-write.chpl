/*
This is a test of Chapel's write() of a string vs. C's printf()
of the same string, which has no formatting in it.

The test exposes Chapel's overhead on top of the actual work
of displaying the string.

To make the timing meaningful, the test performs write()/printf()
multiple times. To reduce the output volume, we use a short string.
This has the (unintentional) effect of emphasizing the overhead.

Since we expect the output to be redirected, due to its high volume,
there may be various startup effects.
To mitigate them, we rotate the variants 'tries' times,
starting with the one we expect to be the fastest.
However, the initial measurements did not support this concern.

Test variations - in C:
* Use printf() or puts().
* For C, wrap printf() in a loop in C or in Chapel.
* Pass "\n" to printf() from Chapel as a Chapel 'string' or 'c_string'.
* For the previous one, make it a global constant or a local constant.
* We could also do the above variations for puts() - skip that for now,
  to reduce the amount of info to deal with, and perhaps puts() is
  less interesting.

Test variations - in Chapel:
* since stdout is blocking, we also try a variant using a workaround of
  creating a non-blocking version of it - see stdoutNB.

Michael's remarks on performance:

+ Chapel's write() or stdout.write()
actually call printf so that Chapel programs and C
programs can intermix their standard output. They
are also both line buffered which reduces performance.
  Chapel's stdout is using the C stdout FILE*,
and calling fwrite. That means that any data
sent to Chapel's stdout is buffered twice in
the application:
 - once in the QIO channel
 - once in the FILE* buffer
I would expect this to reduce performance.

+ We could revisit that design decision and make
write use file descriptor 1 if we no longer wanted
it to work this way. It would go faster but possibly
result in unexpected intermixings of stdout.

+ The performance lag of Chapel with openfd(1)
is worth investigating regardless of the above.

+ I also think that it's important to compare
locking=false with printf_unlocked.
[See "man unlocked_stdio" - basically it is the C version of printf
that does not lock the FILE* so it's only safe to use in a serial context.]
