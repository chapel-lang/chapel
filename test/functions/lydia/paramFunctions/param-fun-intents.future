semantic: expected behavior and use of intents with param functions

This test tries to utilize the out intent with a param function.  The result is
that the values stored in the function's arguments are not copied back to the
variables sent to the function as one would expect when using an out intent.

Assignment to an execution time variable within a param function is going to be
ignored when the function is evaluated.  It would be surprising for this to
happen with no indication as to what is going wrong, so a warning message should
be provided.

We may also wish to consider adding a warning for when the out intent is used
with a param function and the assignment does not occur.
