bug: Internal error for function declaration with missing body

This incorrect function declaration currently fails with an obscure error message.
The problem should probably be caught closer to parsing so a more reasonable
message can be generated.

At a guess, I would say this is related to our extern function implementation.

When compiled with CHPL_DEVELOPER=true, the message generated is
problem.chpl:1: internal error: every return type must also have a ref type. [checkAST.cpp:267]
