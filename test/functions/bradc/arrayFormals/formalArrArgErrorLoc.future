error message: formal-actual array arg errors are on callee, not caller

This test shows that with the work I've just completed on reporting
mismatches between actual array args and formals that specify a
domain, any execution-time errors are reported on the callee rather
than the caller, which is not ideal.  The most straightforward fix to
this would seem to be to introduce extra arguments in such cases to
pass the callee filename, line# information down and use it in the
verification call, but I have not had the chance to implement that
yet.
