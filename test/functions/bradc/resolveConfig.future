bug: out-of-order resolution

This test shows a similar issue to

  test/modules/deitz/test_module_mutual_use.chpl

There is a problem in function resolution determining the types because the
variables rely on one another for their initialization (and type inference).
There is also a problem at runtime.  Which initialization is done well.  I
think that is well defined, but subtle.

bug: array sized by external module config

For some reason, it seems that if an array size is
set using a config variable from a separate module,
we get a problem in function resolution.  Not sure
if this is a resolution problem or a function
resolution problem.
