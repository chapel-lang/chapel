error message: const arrays

semantic: return values should be const by default?

Since we allow functions to be labeled as var, param, and type,
my hypothesis was that our unlabeled functions were probably
const.  Record assignment and array assignment seem like the
two cases for which this might not happen automatically, though
Steve and I currently think they should for consistency.
Modifying records returned by functions isn't particularly useful,
because you can't capture the record without copying it.
Modifying arrays might be considered more useful, but also
reasonable to outlaw for consistency.

If for some reason this doesn't pan out, we might want to say
that a blank function kind is like a blank argument kind in
that the semantics depend on the type.  This seems like it
would be nice to avoid if possible, though.
