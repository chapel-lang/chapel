feature request: support class and record methods with proc type syntax

Similar to static class methods in java and c++, this feature request
introduces a class method. A common use case is factory methods, although there
are plenty of other ways they are useful.

This also shows how pseudo-attributes could be used with paren-less proc type
methods.
