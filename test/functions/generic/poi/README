POI: Point of Instantiation examples

This directory contains examples that rely on the Point of Instantiation rule
or illustrate its current limitations. The focus is on scenarios that are
likely to occur in user code.

Many tests issue compilerError() upon successful resolution.
This is because they illustrate the resolution of a specific call
and do not have interesting run-time behavior.

The .good files reflect the compiler's current behavior,
which ideally we would like to preserve.

See #15752 for a discussion.
