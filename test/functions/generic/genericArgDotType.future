bug: .type on generic argument

It seems as though applying .type to an argument with a specified, but
generic, formal type should refer to the type of the actual with which
the function was instantiated, not be a copy of the generic formal
type.  This test suggests that we're taking the latter interpretation
at present.  The test genericArgDotType2.chpl, in which the first
argument's type is completely specified, demonstrates how I think it
should work.
