error message: Incorrect error message when zippering in a tuple with an array

The original intent of this test was to test nested zippered
iteration, which is not something we support any more.  The test was
updated incorrectly.

The current error message states that we are trying to zipper a
heterogeneous tuple, but that is incorrect.

See test/types/tuple/sungeun/iteration.future for details on they
actual bug here.
