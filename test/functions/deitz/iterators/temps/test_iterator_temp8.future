error message: Incorrect error message when zippering in a tuple with an array

The original intent of this test was to test nested zippered
iteration, which is not something we support any more.  The test was
updated incorrectly.

The current error message states that we are trying to zipper a
heterogeneous tuple, but that is incorrect.


In this example:

  for ij in zip((i1(), i2()), i1()) do
    writeln(ij);

the first tuple (i1(), i2()) is a tuple of arrays, yet their types are
represented by the iterator record, so that the test for homogenous
tuple fails during function resolution.
