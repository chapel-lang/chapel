Bug: Copy propagation can not follow references through record fields

This test started to fail after 4160bf4 (Add peephole optimization to remove
ref temps). The actual failure is due to copy propagation not being able to
follow references through record fields. If this test is run with scalar
replacement, it works correctly since the record fields will be extracted.
