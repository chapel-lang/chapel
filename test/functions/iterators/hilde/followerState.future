feature request: Allow the iteration state in a follower to be named arbitrarily.

Right now, the call to a follower iterator has a stylized signature which is
enforced by the compiler.  The compiler "knows" that it occupies the first
"real" argument position (after the param tag argument).  But also insists that
it be named "follower".  It would be nice to be able to name this arbitrarily.

Brad also suggested encapsulating iterators within a class, so that they contain
a place to store common state data.  But it is nice to retain the capability of
defining "loose" iterators.  A great deal of flexibility is retained by using
positional notation, i.e.:
 -- the first formal is the iterator state (supplied by the leader).
 -- the second formal (if present) receives the context state:
    the object supplied as an argument to the leader.
