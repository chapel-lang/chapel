feature request: recursive standalone iterators

Using a for loop in the standalone iterator instead of forall and
explicitly passing tag to the recursive invocation allows this test
to pass.  It would be nice to be able to use a forall loop and have
something like that transformation apply automatically.

Initial text of this .future file:
When writing a recursive standalone iterator, we get a somewhat
confusing error message pointing to an internal module.  This future
can be perceived as a feature request to add support for recursive
standalone parallel iterators, if possible.  Or, if not, as a request
to improve the error message if there's a good reason that we can't
support recursive standalone iterators.
