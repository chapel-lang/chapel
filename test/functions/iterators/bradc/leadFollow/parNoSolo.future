semantic: parallel iteration without sequential?

This future asks the question whether one should be able to create
and use leader/follower iterators for a class if no sequential
iterator is defined.  Currently, you cannot and get a message:

parNoSolo.chpl:15: error: cannot iterate over values of type C

If we want/need to require the sequential error message, this
can get reclassified as an error message future since it would
be more accurate to say that we cannot iterate over values of
type C in parallel without being able to iterate over them
sequentially.

It seems like it would be nice to permit this, though.
