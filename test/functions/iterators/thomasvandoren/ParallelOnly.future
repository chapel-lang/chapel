feature request: write standalone parallel iterator, without serial version

If this is added to ParallelOnly.chpl, it works as expected:

    iter myIter() {
        yield "";
    }

There might be cases where only a standalone parallel iterator is needed, so it
seems like a burden to also have to define a serial iterator.
