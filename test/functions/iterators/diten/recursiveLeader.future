feature request: recursive leader iterators

This test mirrors functions/iterators/bradc/recursiveStandalone.chpl

Using a for loop in the leader iterator instead of forall and
explicitly passing tag to the recursive invocation allows this test
to pass.  It would be nice to be able to use a forall loop and have
something like that transformation apply automatically.
