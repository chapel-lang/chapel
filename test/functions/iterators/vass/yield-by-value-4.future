bug: memory leak when detupling an iterator into _

Given

   for/forall (idx1, _, idx3) in myIter() do ....

currently the value corresponding to the `_` leaks.

// Once this is fixed, this test can be removed
// and instead the tests yield-by-value-2.chpl and yield-by-value-3.chpl
// can be extended by adding a sibling to `ARR` that is included in
// the tuple yielded by each iterator and by adding an `_` to each
// detupling expression.
