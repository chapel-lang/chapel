error message: better error message for iterators with the void return type

Currently it says: "illegal use of function that does not return a value",
which does not point to the issue very clearly.

Developer's note: the error is issued in functionResolution.cpp
when it comes across PRIM_MOVE(retval,ret_expr) (or similar),
which is created in normalize_returns(). Since normalize happens
before function resolution, we will not necessarily catch it there
(as exemplified by void-iterator-error.chpl).

Also: need make sure the error message and location still make sense
when the iterator is in an internal module. Specifically,
functionResolution.cpp use userCall(call) to determine the location,
which may cause it not point to the actual void-typed iterator.
