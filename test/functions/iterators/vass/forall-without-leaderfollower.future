feature request: 'these' should enable forall loops

This is a variation on

  test/functions/promotion/theseShouldPromote2.future
  https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/5114

except with an explicit forall instead of (implicit) promotion.
The record-vs-class difference is insignificant w.r.t. #5114 .
