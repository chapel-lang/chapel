bug: cannot C-compile chpl-generated code

I get this when chpl-compiling the program:

In file included from /tmp/chpl-vass-3018.deleteme/_main.c:1:
/tmp/chpl-vass-3018.deleteme/chpl__header.h:779: error: conflicting types for ‘chpl_main’
/users/vass/chapel/runtime/include/chplcgfns.h:15: error: previous declaration of ‘chpl_main’ was here

---------------------------------
feature request: allow closures to outlive, at run time,
the function invocations that contain local variables captured by the closure.

(Just recording one issue with the current first class functions.)
