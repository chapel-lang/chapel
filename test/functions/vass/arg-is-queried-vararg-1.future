feature request: for a vararg formal with each formal's type being generic, allow querying of that generic type's parameters, in addition to the number of vararg actuals

While the sample code looks reasonable to me, currently I get:

arg-is-queried-vararg-1.chpl:1: In function 'test':
arg-is-queried-vararg-1.chpl:4: error: illegal access to query type or parameter [normalize.cpp:877]

This is simlar to arg-is-queried-tuple-1.chpl.
