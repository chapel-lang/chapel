bug: type alias to a class/record with a generic param field in a function does not work

The following does not work:

  type T = someClass(formal);

where someClass has a param field and 'formal' is a param formal
of the function that this decl is inside of.

Various other compile-time combinations do work - see

  compile-time-messages.chpl

When retiring this future:
* uncomment the corresponding lines in compile-time-messages.chpl
* remove this test altogether
