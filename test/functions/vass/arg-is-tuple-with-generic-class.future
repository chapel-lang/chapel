bug: compiler crashes with an assertion

Currently I get:

  error: assertion error [callInfo.cpp:32]

The culprit apparently is the (?) after TestDom. I.e. if we remove (?),
the compiler gives a somewhat-meaningful error message. If we add ?s
(e.g. TestDom(?,?,?)), the compiler still crashes the same way.

Note on the desired behavior:
What I'd like to say here is that the 'follower' arg is a tuple (a pair)
whose first element is a TestDom. The compiler should either tell me
that I am not doing it right (ideally with a suggestion on how to do it)
or just accept it and compile successfully. (My .good assumes the latter.)

(This test case distills my leader/follower attempt for DefaultSparseDom.)
