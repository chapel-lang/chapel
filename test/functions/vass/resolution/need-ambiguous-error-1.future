bug: an "ambiguous call" error is not reported

Seems like the compilerError function that's in the internal module
(and whose copy is in the test code)
is not considered a worthy contestant for the function call
when there is an exactly the same user-defined function.

This doesn't sound right to me. If this is the intended behavior,
we should discuss it as a group and document it.

If I have two copies of the same compilerError() in the test code,
I correctly get an "ambiguous call" error.
