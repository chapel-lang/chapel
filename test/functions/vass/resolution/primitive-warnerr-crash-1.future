feature request: allow the "error" and "warning" primitives to work in more cases

Right now compiling each of co1 and co2 results in compiler crashing:

error: assertion error [functionResolution.cpp:1542]

Using the "error" primitive instead of "assertion" results in the same crash.

Motivation: would like to implement compilerAssert more elegantly.
