error message: when resolving a call with an unresolvable argument type

Currently I am getting:

  undefined-type-error-1.chpl:5: error: unresolved call 'DD.funD(int, 0)'
  undefined-type-error-1.chpl:6: note: candidates are: DD.funD(arg: dummy, extras)

While this gets me to the cause pretty easily in this case,
this diagnosis can be misleading in a complex setting.

The real issue is that 'dummy' does not specify a type here,
which should be what the error message says.
