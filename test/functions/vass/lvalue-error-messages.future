error message: include the compound assignment in the error message; do not mention "formals" of <=>

When we use a non-lvalue with op= or <=>...

For +=, currently we get the generic "illegal lvalue in assignment".
Would be nice to make it more specific, e.g. "illegal lvalue in assignment +=".
The same goes for the other compound assignments.

For <=>, currently the error message sounds like it is a function with
ref formals.  Instead, I'd prefer the error message to refer to it
as the swap operator or (shown in .good) simply <=>, and complain
about non-lvalue-ness, in accordance with the spec terminology.
