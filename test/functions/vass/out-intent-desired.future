bug: the compiler requires the type of an actual to match the type of its formal when it has the 'out' intent

This follows up on a discussion I had with Brad and Tom, whose outcome
is documented in "the out intent" section of the spec as of r23271.

Currently the compiler implements 'out' argument passing
by reference, so the exact type match is required. However, it is
semantically possible to relax that requirement to allow
implicit conversion, or better yet, assignment from the formal
to the actual upon the function's return. Tom was excited
about this generalization, while Brad was OK with either choice.

One implementation - or performance - challenge for the more general case
seems to be a need in a temporary to store the final value of the formal
before assigning it to the actual, if their types differ.
