semantic: Param functions can call functions with side effects, but they are ignored.

This code currently ignores the fact that a writeln() call is made
within a param function and basically drops the writeln() calls on the
floor.

I think at least two of us would like to see pure functions (in the
'side effect free' sense) permitted within type/param functions, and
to have others (such as writeln()) generate a compile-time error or
warning.
