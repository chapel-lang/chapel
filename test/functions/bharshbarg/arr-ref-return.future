bug: ref return semantics always invoke `ref` case if returning an array, even if that array is only read.

This issue was initially encountered while working on miniMD's StencilDist.
StencilDist was initially written to rely on the `setter` param variable to
know when a write to an element occurred. It seems that `setter` logic had been
flawed long before Michael's ref return change (#3232). This appears to occur
for both arrays-of-arrays and simple arrays of other types.
