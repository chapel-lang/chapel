bug: Reading from a sparse array of dense arrays results in a runtime error when the index was not added

It seems that reading from a sparse array of dense arrays will always enter the
'ref' return case. If the index we're reading from is was not added to the
sparse domain, then the 'ref' case will halt. I think the correct behavior
is to enter the 'const ref' case which ought to return the IRV.
