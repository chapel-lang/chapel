bug: indexing into an associative array of arrays will cause an element to be created for that index

Associative arrays allows a user to implicitly add an index/element pair with
the following statement:

```
// '42' added to myArr.domain, '11' assigned to myArr[42]
myArr[42] = 11;
```

When the element type is an array this add-assign case is always triggered, even
if only performing read operations.
