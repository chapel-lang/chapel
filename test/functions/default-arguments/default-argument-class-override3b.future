bug: dynamically dispatched methods with default type arguments wrong

#15164

This test demonstrates that when methods are dynamically dispatched
and have type arguments with defaults, the compiler doesn't use the
default from the method that was chosen dynamically, but the one based
on the static type.  This is because we implement default arguments
as methods currently, and can't dynamically dispatch type methods.
Yet we have to statically invoke the default arguments in order to
fulfill the `type` nature of the arguments.
