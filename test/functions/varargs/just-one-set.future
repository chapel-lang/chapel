unimplemented feature: No support for multiple typed var-arg sets

The specification does not discuss this opportunity but there is informal
support for adding in one day.  The current implementation would need
non-trivial work to do this but this seems like a low priority goal.

Lock in the fact that the compiler will warn about this.
