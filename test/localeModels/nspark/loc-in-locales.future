bug: Compiling forall loc in locales, containing a channel yields internal error

The desirable compiler error would be the same as the error in the case of the
simple for loop, c.f. good file.

Filed as JIRA issue #184


The current compiler error output is the following:

loc-in-locales.chpl:3: internal error: FUN0493 chpl Version 1.12.0.c3cd1e5
Note: This source location is a guess.

Internal errors indicate a bug in the Chapel compiler ("It's us, not you"),
and we're sorry for the hassle.  We would appreciate your reporting this bug --
please see http://chapel.cray.com/bugs.html for instructions.  In the meantime,
the filename + line number above may be useful in working around the issue.
