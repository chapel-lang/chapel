\sekshun{Locality and Distribution}
\label{Locality_and_Distribution}

Chapel provides high-level abstractions that allow programmers to
exploit locality by defining the affinity of data and tasks.  This is
accomplished by associating both data objects and tasks with abstract
{\em locales}. To provide a higher-level mechanism, Chapel allows a
mapping from domain indices to locales to be specified. This mapping
is called a {\em distribution} and it guides the placement of elements
within arrays and the placement of tasks over domains.

\index{local}
\index{remote}
Throughout this section, the term {\em local} refers to data that is
associated with the locale that a task is running on and {\em remote}
refers to data that is not. We assume that there is some execution
overhead associated with accessing data that may be remote compared to
data known to be local.

\subsection{Locales}
\label{Locales}
\index{locales}

A \emph{locale} is a portion of the target parallel architecture that
has processing and storage capabilities.  Chapel implementations
should typically define locales for a target architecture such that
tasks running within a locale have roughly uniform access to values
stored in the locale's local memory and longer latencies for accessing
the memories of other locales.  As an example, a cluster of multicore
nodes or SMPs would typically define each node to be a locale.  In
contrast a pure shared memory machine would be defined as a single
locale.

\subsubsection{The Locale Type}
\label{The_Locale_Type}
\index{locale@\chpl{locale}}

The identifier \chpl{locale} is a primitive type that abstracts a
locale as described above.  Both data and tasks can be associated with
a value of locale type. The only operators defined over locales are
the equality and inequality comparison operators.

\subsubsection{Locale Methods}
\label{Locale_Methods}
\index{Locales!methods}

The locale type supports the following methods:

\begin{protohead}
def locale.id: int;
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns a unique integer for each locale, from 0 to the number of
locales less one.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
def locale.numCores: int;
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns the number of processor cores available on a given locale.
\end{protobody}

\begin{protohead}
use Memory;
def locale.physicalMemory(unit: MemUnits=MemUnits.Bytes, type retType=int(64)): retType;
\end{protohead}
\begin{protobody}
Returns the amount of physical memory available on a given locale in
terms of the specified memory units (Bytes, KB, MB, or GB) using a
value of the specified return type.
\end{protobody}

\subsubsection{Predefined Locales Array}
\label{Predefined_Locales_Array}
\index{Locales@\chpl{Locales}}
\index{numLocales@\chpl{numLocales}}
\index{execution environment}

Chapel provides a predefined environment that stores information about
the locales used during program execution.  This {\em execution
environment} contains definitions for the array of locales on which
the program is executing (\chpl{Locales}), a domain for that array
(\chpl{LocaleSpace}), and the number of locales (\chpl{numLocales}).
\begin{chapel}
config const numLocales: int;
const LocaleSpace: domain(1) = [0..numLocales-1];
const Locales: [LocaleSpace] locale;
\end{chapel}
When a Chapel program starts, a single task executes \chpl{main}
on \chpl{Locales(0)}.

Note that the Locales array is typically defined such that distinct
elements refer to distinct resources on the target parallel
architecture.  In particular, the Locales array itself should not be
used in an oversubscribed manner in which a single processor resource
is represented by multiple locale values (except during development).
Oversubscription should instead be handled by creating an aggregate of
locale values and referring to it in place of the Locales array.

\begin{rationale}
This design choice encourages clarity in the program's source text and
enables more opportunities for optimization.

For development purposes, oversubscription is still very useful and
this should be supported by Chapel implementations to allow
development on smaller machines.
\end{rationale}

\begin{example}
The code
\begin{chapel}
const MyLocales: [loc in 0..numLocales*4] locale = Locales(loc%numLocales);
on MyLocales(i) ...
\end{chapel}
defines a new array \chpl{MyLocales} that is four times the size of
the \chpl{Locales} array.  Each locale is added to
the \chpl{MyLocales} array four times in a round-robin fashion.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{The {\em here} Locale}
\label{here}
\index{here@\chpl{here}}

A predefined constant locale \chpl{here} can be used anywhere in a
Chapel program.  It refers to the locale that the current task is
running on.

\begin{example}
The code
\begin{chapel}
on Locales(1) {
  writeln(here.id);
}
\end{chapel}
results in the output \chpl{1} because the \chpl{writeln} statement is
executed on locale 1.
\end{example}

The identifier \chpl{here} is not a keyword and can be overridden.

\subsubsection{Querying the Locale of an Expression}
\label{Querying_the_Locale_of_a_Variable}
\index{locale@\chpl{locale}}

The locale associated with an expression (where the expression is
stored) is queried using the following syntax:
\begin{syntax}
locale-access-expression:
  expression . `locale'
\end{syntax}
When the expression is a class, the access returns the locale on which
the class object exists rather than the reference to the class.  If
the expression is a value, it is considered local.  The implementation
may warn about this behavior.  If the expression is a locale, it is
returned directly.

\begin{example}
Given a class C and a record R, the code
\begin{chapel}
on Locales(1) {
  var x: int;
  var c: C;
  var r: R;
  on Locales(2) {
    on Locales(3) {
      c = new C();
      r = new R();
    }
    writeln(x.locale);
    writeln(c.locale);
    writeln(r.locale);
  }
}
\end{chapel}
results in the output
\begin{chapel}
1
3
1
\end{chapel}
The variable \chpl{x} is declared and exists on \chpl{Locales(0)}.
The variable \chpl{c} is a class reference.  The reference exists
on \chpl{Locales(1)} but the object itself exists
on \chpl{Locales(3)}.  The locale access returns the locale where the
object exists.  Lastly, the variable \chpl{r} is a record and has
value semantics.  It exists on \chpl{Locales(1)} even though it is
assigned a value on a remote locale.
\end{example}

\subsection{Invoking Remote Tasks}
\label{Specifying_Locales}

When execution is proceeding on some locale, a task can be associated
with a different locale in two ways: via distributions as discussed
in~\rsec{Distributions} or with an \sntx{on-statement} as discussed
below.

\subsubsection{The On Statement}
\label{On}
\index{on@\chpl{on}}

The on statement controls on which locale tasks should be executed or
data should be placed.  The syntax of the on statement is given by
\begin{syntax}
on-statement:
  `on' expression `do' statement
  `on' expression block-statement
\end{syntax}
The locale of the expression is automatically queried as described
in~\rsec{Querying_the_Locale_of_a_Variable}.  Execution of the
statement occurs on this specified locale and then continues after
the \chpl{on-statement}.

The following statements may not be lexically enclosed in
on-statements: yield-statements and return-statements.

\begin{openissue}
It may be worthwhile to allow yields in on-statments such that when a
loop iterates over an iterator, on-statements inside the iterator
control where the corresponding loop body is executed.  For example,
an iterator over a distributed tree might include an iterator over the
nodes as defined in the following code:
\begin{chapel}
class Tree {
  var left, right: Tree;
  def nodes {
    on this do yield this;
    if left then
      for t in left.nodes do
        yield t;
    if right then
      for t in right.nodes do
        yield t;
  }
}
\end{chapel}
Given this code and a binary tree of type \chpl{Tree} stored in
variable \chpl{tree}, then we can use the \chpl{nodes} iterator to
iterate over the tree with the following code:
\begin{chapel}
for t in tree.nodes {
  // body executed on t as specified in nodes
}
\end{chapel}
Here, each instance of the body of the \chpl{forall} loop is executed
on the locale where the corresponding object \chpl{t} is located.
This is specified in the \chpl{nodes} iterator where the \chpl{on}
keyword is used.  In the case of zipper or tensor product iteration,
the location of execution is taken from the first iterator.  This can
be overridden by explicitly using \chpl{on} in the body of the loop or
by reordering the product of iteration.
\end{openissue}

\subsubsection{Remote Variable Declarations}
\label{remote_variable_declarations}

By default, when new variables and data objects are created, they are
created in the locale where the task is running.  Variables can be
defined within an \sntx{on-statement} to define them on a particular
locale such that the scope of the variables is outside
the \sntx{on-statement}.  This is accomplished using a similar syntax
but omitting the \chpl{do} keyword and braces.  The syntax is given
by:
\begin{syntax}
remote-variable-declaration-statement:
  `on' expression variable-declaration-statement
\end{syntax}

\subsection{Distributions}
\label{Distributions}
\index{distributions}

\begin{openissue}
This section is largely forthcoming.
\end{openissue}

A mapping from domain index values to locales is called a {\em
distribution}.

\subsubsection{Distributed Domains}
\label{Distributed_Domains}

\index{domains!distributed}
A domain for which a distribution is specified is referred to as a
{\em distributed domain}.
%A domain supports a method, \chpl{locale}, that maps index values in
%the domain to locales that correspond to the domain's distribution.

Iteration over a distributed domain implicitly executes the controlled
task in the domain of the associated locale.  Similarly, when
iterating over the elements of an array defined over a distributed
domain, the controlled tasks are determined by the distribution of the
domain.  If there are conflicting distributions in product iterations,
the locale of a task is taken to be the first component in the
product.

\begin{example}
If \chpl{D} is a distributed domain, then in the code
\begin{chapel}
forall d in D {
  // body
}
\end{chapel}
the body of the loop is executed in the locale where the
index \chpl{d} maps to by the distribution of \chpl{D}.
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Distributed Arrays}
\label{Distributed_Arrays}
\index{arrays!distributed}

Arrays defined over a distributed domain will have the element
variables stored on the locale determined by the distribution.  Thus,
if \chpl{d} is an index of distributed domain \chpl{D} and \chpl{A} is
an array defined over that domain, then \chpl{A(d).locale} is the
locale to which \chpl{d} maps to according to \chpl{D}.

\subsubsection{Undistributed Domains and Arrays}
\label{Undistributed_Domains_and_Arrays}

If a domain or an array does not have a distributed part, the domain
or array is not distributed and exists only on the locale on which it
is defined.

\subsection{Standard Distributions}
\label{Standard_Distributions}

Standard distributions include the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The block distribution \chpl{Block}
\item The cyclic distribution \chpl{Cyclic}
\item The block-cyclic distribution \chpl{BlockCyclic}
\item The cut distribution \chpl{Cut}
\end{itemize}

A design goal is that all standard distributions are defined with the
same mechanisms that user-defined
distributions~(\rsec{User_Defined_Distributions}) are defined with.

\subsection{User-Defined Distributions}
\label{User_Defined_Distributions}

This section is forthcoming.
