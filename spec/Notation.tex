\index{notation}

Special notations are used in this specification to denote Chapel code
and to denote Chapel syntax.

Chapel code is represented with a fixed-width font where keywords are
bold and comments are italicized.
\begin{example}
\begin{chapel}
for i in D do   // iterate over domain D
  writeln(i);   // output indices in D
\end{chapel}
\end{example}

Chapel syntax is represented with standard syntax notation in which
productions define the syntax of the language.  A production is
defined in terms of non-terminal ({\it italicized}) and terminal
(non-italicized) symbols.  The complete syntax defines all of the
non-terminal symbols in terms of one another and terminal symbols.

A definition of a non-terminal symbol is a multi-line construct.  The
first line shows the name of the non-terminal that is being defined
followed by a colon.  The next lines before an empty line define the
alternative productions to define the non-terminal.
\begin{example}
The production
\begin{syntax_donotcollect}
bool-literal:
  `true'
  `false'
\end{syntax_donotcollect}
defines \sntx{bool-literal} to be either the symbol \sntx{`true'} or
\sntx{`false'}.
\end{example}
In the event that a single line of a definition needs to break across
multiple lines of text, more indentation is used to indicate that it
is a continuation of the same alternative production.

As a short-hand for cases where there are many alternatives that
define one symbol, the first line of the definition of the
non-terminal may be followed by ``one of'' to indicate that the single
line in the production defines alternatives for each symbol.
\begin{example}
The production
\begin{syntax_donotcollect}
unary-operator: one of
  +   -   ~   !
\end{syntax_donotcollect}
is equivalent to
\begin{syntax_donotcollect}
unary-operator:
  +
  -
  ~
  !
\end{syntax_donotcollect}
\end{example}

As a short-hand to indicate an optional symbol in the definition of a
production, the subscript ``opt'' is suffixed to the symbol.
\begin{example}
The production
\begin{syntax_donotcollect}
formal:
  formal-tag identifier formal-type[OPT] default-expression[OPT]
\end{syntax_donotcollect}
is equivalent to
\begin{syntax_donotcollect}
formal:
  formal-tag identifier formal-type default-expression
  formal-tag identifier formal-type
  formal-tag identifier default-expression
  formal-tag identifier
\end{syntax_donotcollect}
\end{example}
