There are five environments for use in the spec:

- example    
  Example Chapel programs, along with explanation text
  should be contained in the example environment.

- status
  If a feature is not fully implemented, it is helpful
  to write a status note that is contained in the
  status environment.

- note
  To make a note to future implementors of Chapel, or those
  who are interested in how Chapel is implemented, use the note
  environment.  

- rationale
  To provide more explanation about a feature, use the rationale
  section.   

- openissue
  Unresolved issues can be noted in the openissue environment.

Guidelines for updating the spec:

- There should be example programs for every language concept.

- In explaining a feature, try to address both the compiler
  developers and programmers of the language.  Explain the syntax of
  the feature and any implementation details.  Also explain the
  impact of the feature and how it is used when programming.

- Try to keep the sections of a chapter relatively consistent
  with each other.  Start out a chapter or section with a summary
  paragraph.  This paragraph could:

  -  compare and/or contrast Chapel with other languages in the areas
     covered by the chapter or section
  -  give insights into how the compiler uses the feature(s) in that 
     chapter or section
  -  state the organization and flow of the chapter or section
