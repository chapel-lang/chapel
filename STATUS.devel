# This file lists all the existing futures that are categorizes as "bug" or
# "unimplemented feature."
#
# All comments will be stripped out before releasing the final STATUS
#
# To remove comments use: grep -v "^\ *#" STATUS.devel (or 'make STATUS')
#
# To further facilitate generating the final STATUS file, please put the
# names of the future files on a separate line from comments (one future
# per line).  For example:
#
#        # path/to/future/blah.future
#
# If for some reason a .future is omitted prepend the name of the future
# with the 'OMITTED:' and use comments to explain.  For example:
#
#        # OMITTED: path/to/future/blah.future
#        #   b/c it's too difficult to explain

Data Parallelism
----------------
  # OMITTED: studies/lsms/shemmy/m-lsms.par-forall.future
  # b/c it is unclear if this is user error or a bug
- Some data parallel statements that should be parallelized are
  serialized with a warning message "X has been serialized".  In some
  case, this can be fixed in the program.
  E.g., Change '+ reduce for i in 1..n do i**2' to
                 '+ reduce forall i in 1..n do i**2' to avoid a
  warning that the reduce has been serialized.  In other cases, this
  is a current limitation:
  1. Scans are always serialized.
  # arrays/deitz/parallelism/test_scan_is_parallel.future
  2. Assignments from ranges to multidimensional arrays are always serialized.
  3. Assignment, reductions, and parallel iteration over opaque domains and
     arrays are always serialized.
   # domains/johnk/associative/literalsWarn.future
- Array promotion/forall/for/scan expressions always evaluate to 1D arrays.
  E.g., f(A) where A promotes f() should result in an array of type:
    [A.domain] f(A(i)).type but instead results in a 1D array
  E.g., [i in D] f(i) should result in an array of type: [D] f(i).type
    but instead results in a 1D array

- Domain promotion results in a race condition.

- Reduction type definitions nested in classes or records cannot be
  used directly outside of enclosing class or record's scope.
  # users/ferguson/histogram/reductionex_class.future

  # domains/sungeun/sparse/plus_equals.future
- Task intents to not work for coforalls and cobegins used in iterators.
  # TODO: are there any futures?  better wording?
- Class or record fields used with ref task intents result in an
  internal compiler error.
  # parallel/taskPar/vass/field-in-task-ref-clause.future
- Iterating over a range where bound+stride overflows the index type
  overflows can result in incorrect execution.
- Overloaded xor used in a reduction may result in an internal
  compiler error.

Standard Modules, Standard Distributions, and Standard Layouts
--------------------------------------------------------------
- On some platforms, the Math module is limited by the back-end C compiler.
- Extended precision math functions are not supported.
  # modules/standard/math/figueroa/extended-precision_math_functions.future
- The BlockCyclic distribution is incomplete.
- Reindexing stridable Cyclic is not fully supported.
  # users/jglewis/test_cyclic_dist.future
- Block and Cyclic domains containing indices near the minimum or
  maximum integral type may overflow.
- Array assignment fails for Block distributions with bounding boxes
  that do not overlap with the bounds of the domain.
  # arrays/sungeun/multilocale/weird_bbox_block.future

  Workaround: use a loop, e.g., for e in A do read(e);

LLVM (experimental)
-------------------
- Extern C blocks do not properly handle C "void *" types.
  # extern/tzakian/void_ptr.future

  reason will not work with GMP)


Multi-locale/GASNet executions
------------------------------
- stdin does not work for multi-locale/GASNet executions


Portability
-----------
Linux64:
- On some systems the GMP fac_ui function causes valgrind to issue invalid
  read errors
  # modules/standard/gmp/lydia/gmp_leak.future

Ubuntu:
- Ubuntu 14.04 32-bit (not 64-bit) has a bug in preadv/pwritev support.
  This problem may prevent proper functioning for many of Chapel's IO
  routines. This problem is not present in Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.10 or any
  64-bit version.  See the bug report here:
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/+bug/1309818

OpenSUSE:
- If the site-config package is installed, it sets a CONFIG_SITE environment
  variable which causes some packages in third-party to store their
  libraries in lib64 (vs lib) on 64-bit platforms. Unsetting CONFIG_SITE will
  allow Chapel to build in that case.

cygwin:
- cygwin builds may demonstrate portability issues.
- The qthreads tasking layer is not supported.
- Some utf8 characters have incorrect lengths on cygwin
  # io/ferguson/utf8/widecols-cygwin-copy.future

OS/X:
- For older version (e.g., leopard), the qthreads tasking layer is not
  supported.
- Static linking not supported.

PGI compilers:
- Chapel generated identifier names may be too long.
- Floating point literals of -0.0 may not work as intended.

Intel compilers:
- Floating point literals of -0.0 may not work as intended.
- Static linking may not work.

IEEE floating-point standard conformance:
  The --ieee-float flag is implemented by passing appropriate flags to
  the back-end compiler.  For some compilers, 100% IEEE floating-point
  conformance is not implemented.  In such cases, the --ieee-float
  flag will request the most standard conformant floating-point
  behavior (if such behavior can be identified).
