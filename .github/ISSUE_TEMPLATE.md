<!-- e.g. `./foo -nl 4`
If an input file is required, include it as well. -->

**Associated Future Test(s):**
<!-- Are there any tests in Chapel's test system that demonstrate this issue?
     e.g. [`test/path/to/foo.chpl`](
           https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/blob/main/test/path/to/foo.chpl
          ) #1234 -->
