# Contributing to Chapel

As an open-source project, Chapel welcomes contributions from the
community.  This document describes the high-level requirements for
contributing changes via pull request to Chapel's git repository,
while other documents linked at the bottom of this one provide
additional detail about the process of contributing to Chapel.


# Chapel and the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Chapel enforces the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) on Pull
Requests (PRs). This means that all commit messages must contain a
signature line to indicate that the developer accepts the DCO.

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they
wrote (or otherwise have the right to submit) the code and changes
they are contributing to the project. Here is the full [text of the
DCO][0], reformatted for readability:

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

      (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source 
          license indicated in the file; or

      (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an
          appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, 
          whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit 
          under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

      (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not 
          modified it.

      (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution 
          (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may 
          be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.


Contributors indicate that they adhere to these requirements by adding
a `Signed-off-by` line to their commit messages.  For example:

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>

The name and email address in this line must match those of the
committing author's GitHub account.

please refer to [Chapel's use of the Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)][1].
