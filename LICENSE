Chapel License Information
==========================

The Chapel implementation is composed of two categories of code:

1) code that was specifically developed for, or contributed to, the
   Chapel project.  This code comprises the core of the Chapel
   implementation: the compiler, runtime, and standard/internal
   modules.  Code in this category is made available under the
   Apache v2.0 license, which can be found in 'LICENSE.chapel' in
   this directory or at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html.

2) code from other open-source projects that we package and
   redistribute for the convenience of end-users.  Packages in this
   category are made available under the terms of their original
   licenses, respectively.

   Packages in this second category are redistributed in the highlight/
   and third-party/ directories.  The following table provides a summary
   of the packages, their uses, and their licenses.

   For a more complete introduction to these packages and their
   licensing terms, refer to highlight/README.md, third-party/README, and the
   README and license files in the subdirectories listed above.

   Note that not all of these packages are used by Chapel by default. The
   following table summarizes the conditions under which each package is used
   (see chplenv.rst for details on CHPL_* settings):

   directory/package  when used
   -----------------  ----------------------------------------------------
   highlight/
     emacs            only used if a user modifies their emacs environment
     vim              only used if a user modifies their vim environment

   third-party/
     chpl-venv        only used when running 'chpldoc', 'start_test',
                        or the developer-only 'chplspell'
     gasnet           only used when CHPL_COMM is 'gasnet'
     gmp              only used when CHPL_GMP is 'gmp'
     hwloc            only used when CHPL_HWLOC is 'hwloc'
     jemalloc         only used when CHPL_MEM is 'jemalloc'
     libfabric        only used when CHPL_COMM is 'ofi'
     llvm             only used when CHPL_LLVM is 'llvm'
     qthread          only used when CHPL_TASKS is 'qthreads'
     re2              only used when CHPL_REGEXP is 're2'
     utf8-decoder     bundled into the Chapel runtime to decode UTF-8 strings
     libunwind        only used when CHPL_UNWIND is 'libunwind'
     whereami         used when starting a program with a launcher

   For packages that are used based on a CHPL_* setting, note that this
   setting may either be explicitly or implicitly set. Additionally,
   some packages are only used if a speculative build was successful.
   See https://chapel-lang.org/docs/usingchapel/chplenv.html to
   see which packages are used by default and which ones are built
   speculatively. You can also check your CHPL_* settings by running
   $CHPL_HOME/util/printchplenv after Chapel has been built
