   :record:`Owned` (along with :record:`~SharedObject.Shared`) manage the
   deallocation of a class instance. :record:`Owned` is meant to be used when
   only one reference to an object needs to manage that object's storage.

   To use :record:`Owned`, store a new class instance in a new Owned
   record as is shown in this example:

   .. code-block:: chapel

     use OwnedObject;
     class MyClass { }

     var myOwnedObject = new Owned(new MyClass());

   When myOwnedObject goes out of scope, the class instance
   it refers to will be deleted.

   Copy initializing from ``myOwnedObject`` or assigning it to another
   :record:`Owned` will leave ``myOwnedObject`` storing a nil value
   and transfer the owned class instance to the other value.

   .. code-block:: chapel

     var otherOwnedObject = myOwnedObject;
     // now myOwnedObject stores nil
     // the value it stored earlier has moved to otherOwnedObject

     myOwnedObject = otherOwnedObject;
     // this assignment moves the value from the right-hand-side
     // to the left-hand-side, leaving the right-hand-side empty.
     // after the assignment, otherOwnedObject stores nil
     // and myOwnedObject stores a value that will be deleted
     // when myOwnedObject goes out of scope.

   The compiler includes support for introducing automatic coercions
   from :record:`Owned` to the contained class type. For example:

   .. code-block:: chapel


     proc f(arg:MyClass) {
       writeln(arg);
     }

     var myOwned = new Owned(new MyClass());
     f(myOwned); // compiler coerces to MyClass via borrow()

   Additionally, the compiler includes support for coercing a value
   of type ``Owned(T)`` to ``Owned(U)`` when ``T`` is a subclass of ``U``.
   For example:

   .. code-block:: chapel

     class Person { }
     class Student : Person { }

     var myStudent = new Owned(new Student());
     var myPerson:Owned(Person) = myStudent;
     // relies on coercion from Owned(Student) to Owned(Person)
     // moves the instance from myStudent to myPerson, leaving
     // myStudent containing nil.

   .. note::

     The ways in which :record:`Owned` may be used are currently limited.
     Copy-initialization, assignment, and `in` intent are expected to work.
     However, it is currently an error to use a :record:`Owned` in a way that
     causes the compiler to add an implicitly copy, such as by returning a
     :record:`Owned` that was passed by reference.
