`owned` (along with :record:`~SharedObject.shared`) manage the
deallocation of a class instance. :record:`owned` is meant to be used when
only one reference to an object needs to manage that object's storage.

Using `owned`
-------------

To use :record:`owned`, use the `owned` keyword when allocating a class
instance, as shown in this example:

.. code-block:: chapel

 class MyClass { }

 var myOwnedObject = new owned MyClass();

When ``myOwnedObject`` goes out of scope, the class instance
it refers to will be deleted.

Copy initializing from ``myOwnedObject`` or assigning it to another
:record:`owned` will leave ``myOwnedObject`` storing a nil value
and transfer the owned class instance to the other value.

.. code-block:: chapel

 var otherOwnedObject = myOwnedObject;
 // now myOwnedObject stores nil
 // the value it stored earlier has moved to otherOwnedObject

 myOwnedObject = otherOwnedObject;
 // this assignment moves the value from the right-hand-side
 // to the left-hand-side, leaving the right-hand-side empty.
 // after the assignment, otherOwnedObject stores nil
 // and myOwnedObject stores a value that will be deleted
 // when myOwnedObject goes out of scope.

It is possible to transfer the ownership to another `owned`
variable before that happens.

`owned` forms part of a type and can be used in type expressions:

.. code-block:: chapel

 var emptyOwnedObject: owned MyClass;


.. _about-owned-borrowing:

Borrowing from `owned`
----------------------

The :proc:`owned.borrow` method returns the pointer managed by the
:record:`owned`. This pointer is only valid as long as the :record:`owned`
is storing that pointer.

The compiler includes a component called the lifetime checker that
can, in many cases, check that a `borrow` does not refer to an object
that could be deleted before the `borrow`. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

 proc test() {
   var a: owned MyClass = new owned MyClass();
   // the instance referred to by a is deleted at end of scope
   var c: borrowed MyClass = a.borrow();
   // c "borrows" to the instance managed by a
   return c; // lifetime checker error! returning borrow from local variable
   // a is deleted here
 }

.. _about-owned-coercions:

Coercions for `owned`
---------------------

The compiler includes support for introducing automatic coercions
from :record:`owned` to the contained class type. This is equivalent
to calling the :proc:`owned.borrow` method. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

 proc f(arg:MyClass) {
   writeln(arg);
 }

 var myOwned = new owned MyClass();
 f(myOwned); // compiler coerces to MyClass via borrow()


Additionally, the compiler includes support for coercing a value
of type ``owned T`` to ``owned U`` when ``T`` is a subclass of ``U``.
For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

 class Person { }
 class Student : Person { }

 var myStudent = new owned Student();
 var myPerson:owned Person = myStudent;
 // relies on coercion from owned Student to owned Person
 // moves the instance from myStudent to myPerson, leaving
 // myStudent containing nil.


.. _about-owned-intents-and-instantiation:

`owned` Intents and Instantiation
---------------------------------

The default intent for :record:`owned` currently depends on whether
or not the formal argument was declared with a type.

If the formal argument has a declared type, the default intent is `in`, meaning
that ownership will occur.

.. code-block:: chapel

  var global: owned MyClass;
  proc saveit(arg: owned MyClass) {
    global = arg; // OK! Transfers ownership from 'arg' to 'global'
    // now that instance will be deleted at end of program
  }
  proc test0() {
    var x = new owned MyClass();
    saveit(x);
    // now x stores `nil` since ownership was transfer to the argument
  }

If the formal argument had no type (i.e. it is generic) and used `const` or
default intent, the argument will not cause ownership transfer and the
function will be instantiated with the borrow type if an owned actual is
supplied. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  proc f(x) {
    writeln("in f, x.type is ", x.type:string);
  }
  proc test1() {
    writeln("in test1");
    var x = new owned MyClass();
    f(x); // f gets a borrow
    writeln("back in test1");
    writeln(x); // so x is not 'nil' at this point
  }

.. note::

  It is expected that this rule will change in the future with
  more experience with this language design.
