     Entries remaining in the memory tracking array represent leaked memory,
     because they are tracked allocations with no corresponding free.

     The dump is performed only if the --memLeaksByDesc option is present and has
     a string argument.
       --memLeaksByDesc="" causes all memory records to be printed.  Same as --memLeaks.
       --memLeaksByDesc="<alloc-type-string>" causes only those memory records
         matching the given <alloc-type-string> to be printed.
     For example, --memLeaksByDesc="string copy data" causes only string copy
     data leaks to be printed.

  // This function is a little tricky as it is called from every

  // local-only data type, so we must use some tricks to copy the
  // c_string from locale 0 to the remote locales.  We use the globals
  // s_memLog and s_memLeaksLog to create global Chapel strings to
  // make them available to all locales.
