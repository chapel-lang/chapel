// This is a dummy chapel that is used to anchor some internal definitions
// during the last day before Doc Freeze for 1.12.  This file is processed
// for docs in modules/Makefile but is not part of the Chapel Module code
// base.
//
// One reason to create this file is that the Chapel compiler, and hence
// chpldoc, fails if it is asked to compile ChapelBase directly.  It is
// speculated that this is because ChapelBase auto-magically included as
// anchor module by the compiler.
