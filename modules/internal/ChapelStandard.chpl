  // should be available to every program (as well as some automatic
  // standard modules that have moved around over time).  Note that
  // these 'public use's make the contents of these modules available
  // to 'use's of this module, but hide the name of the module itself
  // (unless 'as xyz;' is also added).  Issue #19793 suggests taking
  // this a step further and not permitting the user to refer to the
  // names of internal modules at all.
