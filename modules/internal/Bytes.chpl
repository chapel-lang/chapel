/*
The following document shows functions and methods used to
manipulate and process Chapel bytes objects. The :record:`bytes` object is
similar to astringbut allows arbitrary data to be stored in it. Methods onbytes`
that interpret the data as characters assume that the bytes are ASCII characters

Casts from bytes to a Numeric Type
-----------------------------------

This module supports casts from :record:`bytes` to numeric types. Such casts
will interpret the bytes as ASCII characters and convert it to the numeric type
and throw an error if the bytes is invalid. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  var b = bytes("a");
  var number = b:int;

throws an error when it is executed, but

.. code-block:: chapel

  var b = bytes("1");
  var number = b:int;

stores the value ``1`` in ``number``.

To learn more about handling these errors, see the
:ref:`Error Handling technical note <readme-errorHandling>`.
