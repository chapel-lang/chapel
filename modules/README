==================================
Chapel Modules Directory Structure
==================================

The directory structure of the modules/ directory is as follows:

./

  dists/    : standard domain maps defining distributions that target
              multiple locales.

  internal/ : Chapel code used to implement the language; modules here
              should be code that the user either need not be aware
              of, or would consider to be part of the Chapel language
              itself (i.e., something you'd document in the language
              specification rather than as part of a library's
              documentation).

  layouts/  : standard domain maps for memory layouts targeting a
              single locale.

  minimal/  : a minimal set of modules designed for developer use when
              trying to focus on a minimal definition of the language
              (currently broken in order to focus on getting strings
              working).

  packages/ : library modules that are not considered part of the
              standard Chapel library, but which may be useful to end
              users.  In some cases these are designed to eventually
              be made standard modules as they receive more attention
              and mature (e.g., Search, Sort); in other cases, we
              anticipate them always being something that would be
              governed by a package manager rather than something you
              should expect every Chapel implementation to support.
              
  standard/ : modules considered part of the standard Chapel library.
