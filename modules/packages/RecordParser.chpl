/*

Read records using regular expressions.

A general purpose record reader/parser for channels. Uses a regular expression
to capture portions of the input, and then assigns each capture to each
record field.

This module makes the following assumptions:

1. The file has been opened for reading and a reader channel has been created

2. The programmer has created a record (NOT a class) in which all fields
   can be cast from strings (i.e no subrecords, arrays etc).

3. The number of captures in the regex string provided MUST match the number
   of fields in the record.

4. The order in which the fields in the record appear must be in the same order
   as the record being parsed.

Example 1
---------

.. code-block:: chapel

  use RecordParser;

  record Bar {
    var beer: string;
    var Name: string;
  }

  var f = open("input1.txt", iomode.rw);
  var fr = f.reader();

  var M = new RecordReader(Bar, fr);

  var c = M.get();
  writeln("The first record read is ", c);

  writeln("The rest of the records are:");
  for r in M.stream() do
    writeln(r);


Example 2
---------

.. code-block:: chapel

  use RecordParser;

  record Beer {
    var name:  string;
    var beerId: int;
    var brewerId: int;
    var ABV: real;
    var style: string;
    var appearance: real;
    var aroma: real;
    var palate: real;
    var taste: real;
    var overall: real;
    var time:  int;
    var profileName:  string;
    var text: string;
  }


  var strt = "\\s*beer/name: (.*)\\s*beer/beerId: (.*)\\s*beer/brewerId: (.*)\\s*beer/ABV: (.*)\\s*beer/style: (.*)\\s*review/appearance: (.*)\\s*review/aroma: (.*)\\s*review/palate: (.*)\\s*review/taste: (.*)\\s*review/overall: (.*)\\s*review/time: (.*)\\s*review/profileName: (.*)\\s*review/text: (.*)";

  var N = new RecordReader(Beer, ffr, strt);
  writeln("========== test of stream() ==============");
  for r in N.stream() do
    writeln(r);
