Download data from a URL or upload data to a URL.

For example, the following program downloads a web-page from http://example.com and outputs each line to stdout:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use URL;
  var urlreader = openUrlReader("http://example.com");
  var str:bytes;
  // Output each line read from the URL to stdout
  while(urlreader.readline(str)) {
    write(str);
  }

.. note::

  This module is currently implemented using :mod:`Curl`. As such, please see
  the :mod:`Curl` documentation to see which protocols are available.

  Open a channel reading from a particular URL.

  :arg url: which url to open (for example, "http://example.com").
  :arg kind: :type:`~IO.iokind` compile-time argument to determine the
              corresponding parameter of the :record:`~IO.channel` type. Defaults
              to ``iokind.dynamic``, meaning that the associated
              :record:`~IO.iostyle` controls the formatting choices.
  :arg locking: compile-time argument to determine whether or not the
                channel should use locking; sets the
                corresponding parameter of the :record:`~IO.channel` type.
                Defaults to true, but when safe, setting it to false
                can improve performance.
  :arg start: zero-based byte offset indicating where in the file the
              channel should start reading. Defaults to 0.
  :arg end: zero-based byte offset indicating where in the file the
            channel should no longer be allowed to read. Defaults
            to a ``max(int)`` - meaning no end point.
  :returns: an open reading channel to the requested resource.

  :throws SystemError: Thrown if a reading channel could not be returned.
