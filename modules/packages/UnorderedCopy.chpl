   .. warning::
     This module represents work in progress. The API is unstable and likely to
     change over time.

   This module provides an unordered version of copy/assign for ``numeric``
   types. The results from this function are not visible until task or forall
   termination or an explicit :proc:`unorderedCopyTaskFence()`, but it can
   provide a significant speedup for bulk assignment operations that do not
   require ordering of operations:

   .. code-block:: chapel

     use BlockDist, UnorderedCopy;

     const size = 10000;
     const space = {0..size};
     const D = space dmapped Block(space);
     var A, reversedA: [D] int = D;

     forall i in D do
       unorderedCopy(reversedA[i], A[size-i]);

     // no fence required, fenced at task/forall termination

     forall (rA, i) in zip(reversedA, D) do
       assert(rA == size-i);


   It's important to be aware that unordered operations are not consistent with
   regular operations and updates may not be visible until the task or forall
   that issued them terminates or an explicit :proc:`unorderedCopyTaskFence()`.

   .. code-block:: chapel

     var a = 0;
     on Locales[1] {
       var b = 1;
       unorderedCopy(b, a);
       writeln(b);        // can print 0 or 1
       unorderedCopyTaskFence();
       writeln(b);        // must print 0
     }


   Generally speaking they are useful for when you have a large batch of remote
   assignments to perform and the order of those operations doesn't matter.

   .. note::
     Currently, this is only optimized for ``CHPL_COMM=ugni``. Other
     communication layers fall back to regular operations. Under ugni, GETs are
     internally buffered. When the buffers are flushed, the operations are
     performed all at once. Cray Linux Environment (CLE) 5.2.UP04 or newer is
     required for best performance. In our experience, buffered gets can
     achieve up to a 5X performance improvement over non-buffered gets for CLE
     5.2UP04 or newer.
