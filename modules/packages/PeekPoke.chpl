   .. warning::
     This module is unstable and the API is likely to change over time.

   This module provides `peek()` and `poke()` operations on atomics. `peek()`
   and `poke()` are non-atomic read and write operations. They can provide a
   performance improvement when local reads/writes are performed and atomicity
   is not required. For example they can be used to initialize an array of
   atomics or perform a reduction when no concurrent updates are occurring.

     use BlockDist, PeekPoke;

     const space = {1..1000};
     const D = space dmapped Block(space);
     var A: [D] atomic int;

     forall i in D do
       A[i].poke(i);

     const sum = + reduce A.peek();
     writeln(sum); // 500500
