   :record:`Shared` (along with :record:`~OwnedObject.Owned`) manage the
   deallocation of a class instance. :record:`Shared` is meant to be used when
   many different references will exist to the object and these references need
   to keep the object alive.

   To use :record:`Shared`, allocate a class instance following this
   pattern:

   .. code-block:: chapel

     var mySharedObject = new Shared(new MyClass(...));

   When mySharedObject and any copies of it go out of scope, the class
   instance it refers to will be deleted.

   Copy initializing or assigning from mySharedObject will make
   other variables refer to the same class instance. The class instance
   will be deleted after all of these references go out of scope.

   .. code-block:: chapel

     var globalSharedObject:Shared(MyClass);

     proc makeGlobalSharedObject() {
       var mySharedObject = new Shared(new MyClass(...));
       globalSharedObject = mySharedObject;
       // now mySharedObject is deinitialized, but the MyClass
       // instance is not deleted until globalSharedObject is deinitialized.
     }

   :record:`Shared` supports coercions to the class type as well as
   coercions from a ``Shared(T)`` to ``Shared(U)`` where ``T`` is a
   subclass of ``U``. See :record:`~OwnedObject.Owned` for examples
   of these coercions.
