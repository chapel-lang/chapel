  A parallel-safe scalable distributed deque. A deque is a double-ended queue that supports
  insertion and removal from both ends of the queue, effectively supporting both
  FIFO, LIFO, and a Total ordering, where the order in which you add them will be
  the exact order you remove them in; for emphasis, a Deque can be used as a Queue,
  a Stack, and a List respectively. The deque enforces a 'barrier', which is a method
  of checking whether you may proceed with an operation, that is wait-free which
  guarantees scalability, where we perform bounds checking. Bounds checking performs
  the necessary checks to ensure two invariants: A `pop` operation never proceeds
  if the deque is empty, and that a `push` operation never proceeds if the deque
  is full. In the case where we have a `pop` and a non-empty deque, or a `push`
  with a non-full deque, we proceed within a single atomic fetchSub or fetchAdd
  respectively, hence is wait-free. In the case that we have a `pop` with a
  empty deque, or a `push` with a full deque, the queueSize becomes either
  negative or over capacity. When this happens, the faulty operation will, via
  remote execution (on-statement), perform a CAS-retry loop. If the opposite operation
  (`push` is the opposite of `pop` and vice-versa) sees the size in a incorrect state,
  it will continue its fetchSub/fetchAdd cycle, also bringing the size closer to
  its correct state. Hence, the fetchSub/fetchAdd cycle is bounded in that the number
  of faulty operations is bounded by the number of opposing operations and
  is also bounded and wait-free. The CAS-retry loop is also bounded by the number
  of overlapping operations and is helped along by the opposing operation, and hence
  is also bounded and wait-free.

  Deque operations are separated into three levels: global, local, and node.
  At a global level, we use simple fetchAdd and fetchSub counters to denote which
  local deque we apply our operation to based on the globalHead and globalTail in
  a way that emulates a deque. At the local-level, after you acquire the LocalDeque
  lock for an operation, you operate on linked nodes in a deque-like manner. Finally,
  at the node-level, each linked list node is an unroll block which is also a deque
  in and of itself. This hierarchical system ensures that we maintain this ordering
  but opens up a bit of non-determinism in terms of overlapping tasks hashing to the
  same LocalDeque, which is linearized on it's lock. While the Deque's ordering
  of elements are always preserved, the ordering in which tasks enter the 'barrier'
  to the point they complete their insertion is not. It is possible that given two
  tasks A and B, for A to finish at the global level before B, but for B to finish
  at the local level before A. However, it should be noted that for any MPMC queue,
  this non-determinism is inherent in all lock-free and wait-free data structures.

  Summary
  ________


  A parallel-safe scalable distributed deque. A deque is a double-ended queue that supports
  insertion and removal from both ends of the queue, effectively supporting both
  FIFO, LIFO, and a Total ordering, where the order in which you add them will be
  the exact order you remove them in; for emphasis, a Deque can be used as a Queue,
  a Stack, and a List respectively.

  .. note::

    This package module is new in 1.16 and may contain bugs. The interface may
    change.  The documentation is being incrementally revised and improved

  Usage
  _____

  First, the :record:`DistDeque` must be initialized before use by calling its constructor.

  .. code-block:: chapel

    var deque = new DistDeque(int, cap=maxElem, targetLocales=ourLocales);

  The deque can be used as a queue by using the :proc:`enqueue` and :proc:`dequeue` convenience
  methods or inserting from one end to remove from another...

  .. code-block:: chapel

    deque.enqueue(1);
    var (hasElem, elem) = deque.dequeue();

  The deque can be used as a stack by using the :proc:`push` and :proc:`pop` convenience methods,
  or insertion and removing from the same ends...

  .. code-block:: chapel

    deque.push(1);
    var (hasElem, elem) = deque.pop();

  The deque can be used as a list by using the :proc:`pushBack`, :proc:`pushFront`, :proc:`popBack`,
  and :proc:`popFront` methods. While the deque is not indexable, the ability to `append` or `prepend`
  is powerful enough to allow a total ordering, allowing the user to define the order by letting them
  insert and remove at whichever ends they so choose.

  .. code-block:: chapel

    var deque = new DistDeque(int);
    forall i in 1 .. N {
      if i % 2 == 0 then deque.pushFront(i);
      else deque.pushBack(i);
    }

  The deque supports both serial and parallel iteration, and a means to iterate in a particular order
  (currently only FIFO and LIFO) using the ``Ordering`` enumerator.

  .. code-block:: chapel

    for elt in deque.these(Ordering.FIFO) {
      // ...
    }

    for elt in deque.these(Ordering.LIFO) {
      // ...
    }

  The deque can also be used in a reduction, although currently reduction only used parallel-iteration, hence
  reduction will be performed in an unordered fashion. In the future, a specific function may be created to
  allow reduction in a certain ordering...

  .. code-block:: chapel

    deque.addBulk(1..100);
    var result = + reduce deque;

  Bugs and Known Issues
  _____________________

  1.  It is not safe to call other methods while iterating, as it will lead to deadlock. It is an open question
      whether using a snapshot approach is better to allow concurrent operations at the expense of elevated memory
      consumption, and iterating directly over elements while holding locks, which strangles potential concurrency.

  2.  Reduction cannot be performed in any ordered way. This may be fixed in the near future, either by adding
      pseudo-parallel iterators that merely yield sequentially in order, or by creating a method to perform reduction
      for the user in a specified ordering.

  3.  This data structure **requires** network atomic support for scalability, and without it will result in degrading
      performance. It is another open question whether a specific implementation that is more friendly for remote-execution
      atomic operations should be provided.

  4.  The ordered serial iterators currently do not work when the ``globalHead`` or ``globalTail`` are negative, which is a
      result of iteration being an after-thought. This will be improved upon soon, but for now if you use :proc:`pushBack`
      or :proc:`pushFront` methods, I would advise against using them for now.

  Planned Improvements
  ____________________

  1.  Double the size of each successor up to some maximum, similar to :mod:`DistributedBag` for unroll blocks.
      Currently they are fixed-sized, but it can benefit from improved locality if a lot of elements are added at
      once.
