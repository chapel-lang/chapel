  A highly parallel segmented multiset. Each node gets its own bag, and in each
  bag it is segmented into 'here.maxTaskPar' segments. Segments allow for actual
  parallelism while operating in that it enables us to manage 'best-case',
  'average-case', and 'worst-case' scenarios by making multiple passes over each
  segment. In the case where there is no oversubscription, the best-case will
  always be achieved (considering any other conditions are also met), while in
  the case of oversubscription or, for example a near empty bag, we fall into
  the 'average-case', etc. Examples of 'best-case' scenarios for a removal would
  be when a segment is unlocked and contains some elements we can drain, and the
  'average-case' would be to find any segment, unlocked or not, that contains
  elements we can drain, and so on.

  This data structure also employs its own load balancing algorithm, beginning
  with a best-effort round-robin algorithm such that each task begins searching
  at another segment (with the added benefit of reducing overall contention), in
  particular is useful for locally distributing insertion operations. Next it also
  employs a work-stealing algorithm that horizontally steals a ratio of elements
  across segments. A segment is considered 'horizontal' if it shares the same
  segment index within [0, here.maxTaskPar); those other segments likely are also
  benefited from local distribution from the round-robin algorithm discussed above.
  We also steal a ratio of elements, say 25%, because it leaves all other segments
  with 75% of their work; the more elements they have, the more we take, but the
  less they have, the less we steal; this also has the added benefit of reducing
  unnecessary work stealing between segments when the bag is nearly emptied. Furthermore,
  stealing horizontally ensures that all segments remain filled and that we still
  achieve parallelism across segments for removal operations. Lastly, we attempt
  to steal a maximum of `N / sizeof(eltType)`, where N is some size in megabytes
  (representing how much data can be sent in one network request), which keeps
  down excessive communication.

  This data structure does not come without flaws; as work stealing is dynamic
  and triggered on demand, work stealing can still be performed in excess, which
  dramatically causes a performance drop. Furthermore, a severe imbalance across
  nodes, such as an unfair distribution of work to a single or small subset of nodes,
  may also causes an equally severe performance degradation. To circumvent this,
  we allow the user to determine manually when to 'balance', which will evenly distribute all
  elements across nodes. This data structure scales in terms of nodes, processors per node,
  and even work load. The larger the work load, the more data that gets stolen when
  stealing work, and better locality of elements among segments. As well, to
  achieve true parallelism, usage of a privatized instance is a requirement, as
  it avoids the overhead of remotely accessing class fields, bounding performance
  on communication.

  Summary
  _______

  A parallel-safe distributed multiset implementation that scales in terms of
  nodes, processors per node (PPN), and workload; The more PPN, the more segments
  we allocate to increase raw parallelism, and the larger the workload the better
  locality (see :const:`distributedBagInitialBlockSize`). This data structure is unordered
  and employs its own work stealing algorithm to balance work across nodes.

  .. note::

    This package module is new in 1.16 and may contain bugs. The interface may
    change.  The documentation is being incrementally revised and improved.

  Usage
  _____

  To use :record:`DistBag`, the constructor must be invoked explicitly to
  properly initialize the structure. Using the default state without initializing
  will result in a halt.

  .. code-block:: chapel

    var bag = new DistBag(int, targetLocales=ourTargetLocales);


  While the bag is safe to use in a distributed manner, each node always operates on it's privatized
  instance. This means that it is easy to add data in bulk, expecting it to be distributed, when in
  reality it is not; if another node needs data, it will steal work on-demand. This may not always be
  desired, and likely will more memory consumption on a single node. We offer a way for the user to
  invoke a more static load balancing approach, called :proc:`balance`, which will redistributed work.

  .. code-block:: chapel

    bag.addBulk(1..N);
    bag.balance();

  Planned Improvements
  ____________________

  1.  Dynamic work-stealing will require an overhaul to use a helper algorithm to keep down
      the number of tasks spawned. Currently user tasks will wait on the current work-stealer
      task, which will spawn is own helper tasks which act as shepherds, which then spawns more
      in a fork-join fashion. This leads to an excessive amount of tasks being spawned at once.
      To make matters worse, the waiting tasks don't even get any elements, nor does the work
      stealing task, which opens up the possibility of live-lock where nodes steal work back
      and forth before either can process it.
  2.  Static work-stealing (A.K.A :proc:`balance`) requires a rework that performs a more distributed
      and fast way of distributing memory, as currently 'excess' elements are shifted to a single
      node to be redistributed in the next pass. On the note, we need to collapse the pass for moving
      excess elements into a single pass, hopefully with a zero-copy overhead.
