Containers for accessing the results of asynchronous execution.

A :record:`Future` object is a container that can store the result of an
asynchronous operation, which can be retrieved when the result is ready.

Usage
-----

A valid :record:`Future` object is not created directly. Instead, a future may
be created by calling the :proc:`async()` function, which takes as arguments
the function to be executed and all arguments to that function.

The following example demonstrates a trivial use of futures. Three computations
are executed asynchronously.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/modules/packages/Futures/futures-doc-simple.chpl
   :language: chapel

.. _valid-futures:

Validity of Futures
-------------------

A future that is initialized by a call to :proc:`async()` or
:proc:`Future.andThen()` is created in a valid state.  Otherwise |---| for
example, when a future is declared but not initialized |---| the future is in
an invalid state and method calls other than :proc:`Future.isValid()` on an
invalid future will :proc:`halt()`.  If such a future object is subsequently
assigned to by a call to :proc:`async()` or :proc:`Future.andThen()`, then
the future will become valid.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/modules/packages/Futures/futures-doc-validity.chpl
   :language: chapel

Task Arguments
--------------

The task argument in a call to :proc:`async()` or :proc:`Future.andThen()`
may be a :ref:`first-class function <readme-firstClassFns>`, a
:ref:`lambda function <readme-lambdaFns>`, or a specially-constructed
class or record.  Such a record must have both a `proc this()` method for the
desired computation and a `proc retType type` method that returns the return
type of the `this()` method.  (The requirement for the `retType` method is
a currently limitation that is intended to be resolved in the future.)
For example:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/modules/packages/Futures/futures-doc-taskfn.chpl
   :language: chapel

Future Chaining
---------------

A continuation to a future (itself a future) can be created via the
:proc:`Future.andThen()` method, which takes as its single argument a function
to be invoked asynchronously (with respect to other tasks) but strictly ordered
in execution after the result of the parent future is ready. The continuation
function takes a single argument, the result of the parent future.

The following examples demonstrate such chaining of futures.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/modules/packages/Futures/futures-doc-chaining1.chpl
   :language: chapel

.. literalinclude:: ../../../test/modules/packages/Futures/futures-doc-chaining2.chpl
