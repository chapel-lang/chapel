   .. warning::
     This module represents work in progress. The API is unstable and likely to
     change over time.

   This module provides a buffered version of network gets for ``numeric``
   types. The get is internally buffered and the buffers are flushed
   implicitly when full or explicitly with :proc:`flushGetBuff()`. This
   buffered operation can provide a significant speedup for bulk GET operations
   that do not require strict ordering of operations.

   .. TODO performance example

   It's important to be aware that buffered GET operations are not consistent
   with regular operations and updates may not be visible until the buffers are
   explicitly flushed with :proc:`flushGetBuff()`.

   .. code-block:: chapel

     var a = 0;
     on Locales[1] {
       var b = 1;
       getBuff(b, a);
       writeln(b);        // can print 0 or 1
       flushGetBuff();
       writeln(b);        // must print 0
     }

   Generally speaking they are useful for when you have a large batch of GETs
   to perform and the order of those operations doesn't matter.

   .. note::
     Currently, this is only optimized for ``CHPL_COMM=ugni``. Other
     communication layers fall back to regular gets. Under ugni GETs
     are internally buffered. When the buffers are flushed, the operations are
     performed all at once. Cray Linux Environment (CLE) 5.2.UP04 or newer is
     required for best performance. In our experience, buffered gets can
     achieve up to a 5X performance improvement over non-buffered gets for
     CLE 5.2UP04 or newer.
