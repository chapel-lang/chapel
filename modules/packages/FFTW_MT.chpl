// Wrapper for multithreaded FFTW version 3.

/*
  Multi-threaded FFT computations via FFTW (version 3)

  This module defines Chapel wrappers around key FFTW routines
  supporting multithreaded execution.  It builds directly on the
  :mod:`FFTW` module, inheriting all of its functionality, so refer to
  that module for documentation on the transforms themselves.

  To use this module:

  1. Ensure that FFTW (version 3) is installed on your system with
     multi-threaded support enabled and that the header and library
     files (e.g., fftw3.h, libfftw3.*) are either installed in a
     standard system location or that your C compiler's environment
     variables are set up to find them (alternatively, the Chapel
     compiler's ``-I`` and ``-L`` flags can be used to specify these
     locations).

  2. Add ``use FFTW_MT;`` to your Chapel code.

  3. Compile and run your Chapel program as usual.


  The steps to making multi-threaded FFTW calls are:

  0. By default, the module will initialize itself to use
     ``here.maxTaskPar`` threads per locale when calling
     :proc:`plan_dft* <FFTW.plan_dft>` routines.  This
     auto-initialization can be disabled by setting
     :param:`autoInitFFTW_MT` to `false` at compile-time and calling
     :proc:`init_FFTW_MT` and :proc:`plan_with_nthreads` manually.  At
     any time during program execution, the number of threads to be
     used by FFTW can be changed by calling :proc:`plan_with_nthreads`
     with a new value.
  
  1. Create, ...

  2. execute, ...

  3. ...and destroy plans as in single-threaded uses of :mod:`FFTW`.

  4. Call :proc:`cleanup_threads` to release the memory used by FFTW's
     threads and :proc:`~FFTW.cleanup` as in single-threaded uses of
     :mod:`FFTW`.

  Note that where the main :mod:`FFTW` module is a single-locale
  module, this one is multi-locale in that, once it is initialized,
  any locale can create and execute plans, though those plans will
  only be valid on that locale.  Calls to :proc:`init_FFTW_MT`,
  :proc:`plan_with_nthreads` and :proc:`cleanup_threads` will take
  those actions across all locales.

// TODO: Should this module be a sub-module of FFTW?  I'm thinking
// so, but unfortunately this didn't occur to me in time for
// version 1.11's code freeze.  The main thing to worry about is
// whether 'use's of external dependences will be too aggressively
// resolved such that the MT library is linked in whenever vanilla
// FFTW is 'use'd.  That seems like it would be easy to fix, though.
