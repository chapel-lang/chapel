  Summary
  _______

  A 'Collection' is an interface for a data structure that is a 'contract' between
  the user and implementer that it fulfills the following:

  1. Is safe parallel-safe, hence is safe to use across multiple tasks across multiple locales.
  2. Supports the basic operations that any data structure needs to be truly useful, that is:

    a. Insertion of an arbitrary element. From this, we can insert bulk arbitrary elements.
    b. Removal of an arbitrary element. From this, we can remove bulk arbitrary elements.
    c. Iteration over all elements. From this, we can perform lookups over all elements.

  From the standpoint of the user, who directly benefits, they obtain a very nice but minimal
  guarantee on the object they are using, and from the implementor's view, they get to the
  benefit from both implementing a well-design interface, and from getting some utility methods
  'for-free'.

  .. note::

    The interface for the Collection modules may change. The documentation for
    the Collection modules are being incrementally revised and improved.

  Bugs and Known Issues
  _____________________

  1.  Parallel iteration is not apart of the core Collections module as currently the Chapel compiler
      will produce an internal error. As such, the utility methods provided 'for-free' use serial iteration.
      This issue has been documented under issue `#6998 <https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/6998>`_ . Couple this
      fact with the fact that ``break`` ing out of a serial iterator will result in resource leakage, where destructors
      are not called, hence Collections using some RAII-based resource cleanup will end up leaking and potentially leaving
      the Collection in an undefined state. This has been documented under issue `#6912 <https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/issues/6912>`_ .
