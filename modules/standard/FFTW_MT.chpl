// Wrapper for multithreaded FFTW version 3.

/*
  Support for key multithreaded FFTW version 3 routines in Chapel trappings

  This module defines a Chapel wrapper around key routines from the
  multithreaded support of FFTW version 3.  This module builds on the
  FFTW module itself and inherits all of its functionality, so refer there
  for most of the documentation.

  The main differences in using this module are:

  0) By default, the module will initialize itself to use
     here.maxTaskPar threads per locale when calling plan_dft*()
     routines.  To override this default or change it during program
     execution, call plan_with_nthreads() manually.
  
  1-3) As in FFTW

  3a) Call cleanup_threads() to release memory used by the FFTW threads.

  Note that whereas the main FFTW.chpl module is a single-locale
  module, this module is multi-locale in that, once it is loaded, any
  locale can create and execute plans, though those plans will only be
  valid on that locale.  Calls to plan_with_nthreads() and
  cleanup_threads() will make those actions occur on all locales.

  At present, clients of the FFTW module must specify fftw3.h,
  -lfftw3, -lfftw3_threads on the command line with the appropriate -I
  and -L flags sufficient to find the files.
*/

module FFTW_MT {
  use FFTW;
  use "-lfftw3_threads", "-lpthread";

  /*
    By default, this module will call init_FFTW_MT() and
    plan_with_nthreads() as part of its initialization.  Users can
    diable this by setting autoInitFFTW_MT at compile-time, in which
    case, they will need to make the calls manually.
