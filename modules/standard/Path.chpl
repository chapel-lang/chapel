/* A file utilities library, specifically related to path operations

   The Path module focuses on manipulation of the path to a file or directory.
   Also provided are constant values representing common idioms that may vary
   across operating systems (though rarely in the modern era), such as general
   references to a parent directory or the current directory.

   .. note::

      This module is currently under development and will expand significantly
      in upcoming releases.  Stay tuned!

   Operations which occur on the files or directories referred to by these paths
   may be found in :mod:`FileSystem` (for operations *on* the file) or :mod:`IO`
   (for operations *within* the file).
