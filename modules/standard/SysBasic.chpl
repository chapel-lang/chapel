/* Types for low-level programming and C integration.
   
   This module provides basic types when those types are not
   platform-dependent. The module :mod:`SysCTypes` contains the
   platform-dependent declarations for C compatibility.

   This module also defines the error types :type:`syserr` and :type:`err_t`.

   When should one use :type:`syserr` and when should one use :type:`err_t`?
   :type:`err_t` is a system error code (a `c_int` by a nicer name to
   indicate its purpose). :type:`syserr` is an enhanced error that might also
   include an error message. All user-facing Chapel library code, or user
   Chapel code, should generally use :type:`syserr`. When wrapping functions
   or declaring them in C, use :type:`err_t` to indicate that a function is
   returning an error code.

   A note about the error code documentation in this file. Error descriptions
   for system errors are included here for convenience only. Other
   documentation, such as system man pages or the POSIX specification are the
   authority on system error codes.

/* A type storing an error code or an error message.
   A syserr can be compared using == or != to an err_t (ie integer error code)
   or to another syserr. A syserr can be cast to or from an err_t. It can be
   assigned the value of an err_t or another syserr. In addition, syserr can be
   checked directly in an if statement like so:
   
   .. code-block:: chapel

     var err: syserr;
     if err then do writeln("err contains an error, ie err != ENOERR");
     if !err then do writeln("err does not contain an error; err == ENOERR");


   When a :type:`syserr` formal has default intent, the actual is copied to the
   formal upon a function call and the formal cannot be assigned within the
   function.
