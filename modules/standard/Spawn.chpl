.. versionadded:: 1.12
  Spawn module added.

Support launching and interacting with other programs.

Using functions in this module, one can create a subprocess
and possibly capture its output. It is also possible to provide
input to a subprocess.

To start a subprocess, use :proc:`spawn` or :proc:`spawnshell`.  To wait for
the subprocess process to finish, use the :proc:`subprocess.wait` or
:proc:`subprocess.communicate` functions.

This example program produces a listing of files in the current directory with
names that begin with ``test.`` by using the ``ls`` command. The
output will be mixed in with the Chapel program's output.

.. code-block:: chapel

  use Spawn;

  var sub = spawn(["ls", "test.*"]);
  sub.wait();

This version also runs the ``ls`` command but uses a pipe
to read the output from the ``ls`` command.

.. code-block:: chapel

  use Spawn;

  var sub = spawn(["ls", "test.*"], stdout=PIPE);

  var line:string;
  while sub.stdout.readline(line) {
    write("ls returned: ", line);
  }

  sub.wait();

Finally, this version uses pipes to provide input to
a subprocess in addition to capturing its output. This
version uses the ``cat`` command, which just prints
back its input.

.. code-block:: chapel

  use Spawn;

  var sub = spawn(["cat"], stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE);

  sub.stdin.writeln("Hello");
  sub.stdin.writeln("World");

  sub.communicate();

  var line:string;
  while sub.stdout.readline(line) {
    write("Got line: ", line);
  }
  // prints out:
  // Got line: Hello
  // Got line: World


.. note::

  As of Chapel v1.12, creating a subprocess that uses :const:`PIPE` to provide
  input or capture output does not work when using the ugni communications
  layer and when using more than one locale. In this circumstance, the program
  will halt with an error message. These scenarios do work when using GASNet
  instead of the ugni layer.

     What about a string for a file path? To support that, use
     arguments like this: stdin:?t = FORWARD 

     * forward it -> posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2
     * close it -> posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose
     * string for file path -> posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen
     * open file descriptor ->  posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2 
                 (dup it to remove close-on-exec flag)
     * in-memory file, HDFS file, etc that don't have
       a file descriptor.

     Note -- it's not possible to thread-safe change directory
     when spawning (unless we fork twice e.g.) since posix_spawn
     does not have a change-directory file action. We could support
     a cwd argument like Python does, but it wouldn't be thread-safe
     without heroic effort on our part.  Boo.

                The command could be found in the current PATH or
                it could be a full path to a file to execute. If the
                executable argument is set, the first argument will
                be the name of the spawned program provided to that
                program and typically shown in process listings.

     :arg env: An array of strings storing the environment to use when
               spawning the child process instead of forwarding the
               current environment. By default, this argument
               is an empty array. In that case,

               process.

                      case, the program to launch is the first element
                      of the args array. If the executable
                      argument is provided, it will be used instead of
                      the first element of the args array as the program
                      to launch. In either case, the program could be
                      found by searching the PATH.

     :arg stdin: indicates how the standard input of the child process
                 should be handled. It could be :const:`FORWARD`,
                 :const:`CLOSE`, :const:`PIPE`, or a file
                 descriptor number to use. Defaults to :const:`FORWARD`.

                  should be handled. It could be :const:`FORWARD`,
                  :const:`CLOSE`, :const:`PIPE`, or a file
                  descriptor number to use. Defaults to :const:`FORWARD`.

     :arg stderr: indicates how the standard error of the child process
                  should be handled. It could be :const:`FORWARD`,
                  :const:`CLOSE`, :const:`PIPE`, :const:`STDOUT`, or
                  a file descriptor number to use. Defaults to
                  :const:`FORWARD`.

     :arg kind: What kind of channels should be created when
                :const:`PIPE` is used. This argument is used to set
                :attr:`subprocess.kind` in the resulting subprocess.
                Defaults to :enum:`IO.iokind.dynamic`.
                 
     :arg locking: Should channels created use locking?
                   This argument is used to set :attr:`subprocess.locking`
                   in the resulting subprocess. Defaults to `true`.

    .. note::
     
        Do not use `buffer` `false` when using :const:`PIPE` for stdin,
        stdout, or stderr.  If `buffer` is `false`, this function does not
        try to send any buffered input to the child process and so could result
        in a hang if the child process is waiting for input to finish.
        Similarly, this function does not consume the output from the child
        process and so the child process could hang while waiting to write data
        to its output while the parent process is waiting for it to complete
        (and not consuming its output).
