/* Support for task barriers.

   The Barrier type provided in this module can be used to prevent tasks
   from proceeding until all other related tasks have also reached the
   barrier.

   In the following example, all of the tasks created by the coforall loop
   will print their "entering the barrier" messages in an unspecified order,
   then all of the tasks will print their "past the barrier" messages, also
   in an unspecified order.  Because of the barrier, all of the
   "entering the barrier" messages will be printed before any of the
   "past the barrier" messages. ::

     use Barrier;

     config const numTasks = here.maxTaskPar;
     var b = new Barrier(numTasks);

     coforall tid in 1..numTasks {
       writeln("Task ", tid, " is entering the barrier");
       b.barrier();
       writeln("Task ", tid, " is past the barrier");
     }

     delete b;

   Future direction
   ----------------
   In the future, we expect to add more language-level support for a
   "task-team" concept.  A task-team will more directly support collective
   operations such as barriers between the tasks within a team.

   The Barrier type is currently implemented as a class, requiring it to be
   explicitly deleted before it goes out of scope.  It is expected that this
   type will be changed into a record allowing it to be automatically
   reclaimed.  When this change happens, code that uses this Barrier will need
   to have the explicit deletes removed, but should require no other changes.

   The current implementation is designed for correctness, but is not expected
   to perform well at scale.  We expect performance at scale to improve as
   this barrier implementation is optimized and as the task-team concept is
   implemented and optimized.
