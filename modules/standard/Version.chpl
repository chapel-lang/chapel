.. highlight:: chapel

This module contains features that support compile-time reasoning
about version numbers in general, and Chapel version numbers
specifically.  In more detail, it features:

* :var:`chplVersion`: the version number of the copy of ``chpl`` used
  to compile the program.

* :type:`sourceVersion`: a type that can be used to represent a semantic
  version number plus an optional commit value.

* :proc:`createVersion`: a utility function for creating new version values

Version numbers in this module are represented using ``param`` values
to permit code specialization by being able to reason about versions
at compile-time.

The :type:`sourceVersion` type supports:

* being printed out or cast to a ``param`` string

* compile-time comparisons via ``==``, ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``,
  and ``>``.  Generally speaking, "less than" corresponds to "is an
  earlier version than."  For example::

    if chplVersion < createVersion(1,23) then
      compilerWarning("This package doesn't support 'chpl' prior to 1.23.0");

*/

module Version {
  // Query the compiler to get its version number and cache those values
  private param chplMajor = __primitive("version major");
  private param chplMinor = __primitive("version minor");
  private param chplUpdate = __primitive("version update");
  private param chplSHA = __primitive("version sha");


  /*
    The version of ``chpl`` used to compile this program.  For an
    official Chapel release, this will have an empty ``commit`` value,
    while for a pre-release, it will indicate the Git SHA.

    Note that, for historical reasons, Chapel ``1.x.y``/``2.x.y``
    corresponds to version ``0.x.y``/``1.x.y`` in traditional semantic
    versioning.

  /*
    This record represents a software version in a Git repository.  It
    uses ``param`` values to represent its components in order to
    support compile-time comparison of version numbers which in turn
    permits code to specialize to specific versions of Chapel.  When
    printed or converted to a string, it is represented as ``version
    major.minor.update (commit)``.

    Note that ordered comparisons between two :type:`sourceVersion`
    values that only differ in their ``commit`` values are not
    supported due to the challenges involved in ordering commit
    values.  However, when a value with an empty ``update`` value is
    compared to one whose ``update`` is non-empty, the latter is
    considered to be earlier than (less than) the former, due to the
    interpretation that it represents a pre-release of the official
    release.  */
