/*
  The :mod:`Memory` module provides procedures which report information
  about memory usage.  With one exception, to use these procedures you
  must enable memory tracking.  Do this by setting one or more of the
  config vars below, using appropriate ``--configVarName=value`` or
  ``-sconfigVarName=value`` command line options when you run the
  program.  If memory tracking is not enabled, calling any procedure
  described here, other than :proc:`locale.physicalMemory`, will cause
  the program to halt with an error message.

  ``memTrack``: `bool`:
    Enable memory tracking.  This causes memory allocations and
    deallocations to be internally tracked, to support logging them on
    the fly and/or producing any of several kinds of memory-related
    reports, described below.

  ``memLeaks``: `bool`:
    Enable memory tracking and produce detailed information about
    leaked memory by invoking :proc:`printMemAllocs` implicitly when
    the program terminates normally.

  ``memLeaksByType``: `bool`:
    Enable memory tracking and produce summary information about
    leaked memory by invoking :proc:`printMemAllocsByType` implicitly
    when the program terminates normally.

  ``memLeaksLog``: `c_string`:
    Enable memory tracking and append a report to the named file when
    the program terminates normally.
    The report contains the compilation command used to build the
    program, the execution command used to run it, the summary
    allocation statistics produced by :proc:`printMemAllocStats`, and the
    summary information about leaked memory produced by
    :proc:`printMemAllocsByType`.
    

  ``memStats``: `bool`:
    Enable memory tracking and produce summary memory statistics by
    invoking :proc:`printMemAllocStats` implicitly at normal program
    termination.

  ``memMax``: `uint`:
    If the value is greater than 0 (zero), enable memory tracking
    and use the value as a limit on the number of bytes of memory
    that can be allocated per top-level (network-connected) locale.
    If during execution the amount of allocated memory exceeds this
    limit on any locale, halt the program with a message saying so.

  The following two config variables do not enable memory tracking;
  they only modify how it is done.


  ``memThreshold``: `uint`:
    If this is set to a value greater than 0 (zero), only allocation
    requests larger than this are tracked and/or reported.

  ``memLog``: `c_string`:
    Memory reporting is written to this file.  By default it is the
    ``stdout`` associated with the process (not the Chapel channel
    with the same name).  Setting this config variable to a file path
    causes the reporting to be written to that named file instead.
    In multilocale executions each top-level locale produces output
    to its own file, with a dot ('.') and the locale ID appended to
    this path.
