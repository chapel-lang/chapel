I/O Overview
------------

A :record:`file` in Chapel identifies a file in the underlying operating system.
Reads to a file are done via one or more fileReaders associated with the file
and writes to a file are done via one or more fileWriters.  Each
:record:`fileReader` or :record:`fileWriter` uses a buffer to provide sequential
read or write access to its file.

For example, the following program opens a file and writes an integer to it:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  try {
    // open the file "test-file.txt" for writing, creating it if
    // it does not exist yet.
    var myFile = open("test-file.txt", ioMode.cw);

    // create a fileWriter starting at the beginning of the file
    // (this fileWriter will not be used in parallel, so does not need to use
    // locking)
    var myFileWriter = myFile.writer(locking=false);

    var x: int = 17;

    // This function will write the human-readable text version of x;
    // binary I/O is also possible.
    myFileWriter.write(x);

    // Now test-file.txt contains:
    // 17

  } catch e: Error {
    // Generally speaking, the I/O functions throw errors.  Handling these
    // errors is application-dependent and is left out of this example for
    // brevity.  Please see the documentation for individual functions for more
    // details about errors that they can throw.
  }

Then, the following program can be used to read the integer:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  try {
    // open the file "test-file.txt" for reading only
    var myFile = open("test-file.txt", ioMode.r);

    // create a fileReader starting at the beginning of the file
    // (this fileReader will not be used in parallel, so does not need to use
    // locking)
    var myFileReader = myFile.reader(locking=false);

    var x: int;

    // Now read a textual integer. Note that the
    // fileReader.read function returns a bool to indicate
    // if it read something or if the end of the file
    // was reached before something could be read.
    var readSomething = myFileReader.read(x);

    writeln("Read integer ", x);
    // prints out:
    // Read integer 17

  } catch e: Error {
    // Generally speaking, the I/O functions throw errors.  Handling these
    // errors is application-dependent and is left out of this example for
    // brevity.  Please see the documentation for individual functions for more
    // details about errors that they can throw.
  }

The :proc:`~IO.read` functions allow one to read values into variables as
the following example demonstrates. It shows three ways to read values into
a pair of variables ``x`` and ``y``.

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  var x: int;
  var y: real;
  /* reading into variable expressions, returning
     true if the values were read, false on EOF */
  var ok:bool = read(x, y);

  /* reading via a single type argument */
  x = read(int);
  y = read(real);

  /* reading via multiple type arguments */
  (x, y) = read(int, real);

Design Rationale
----------------

Since fileReaders and fileWriters operate independently, concurrent I/O to the
same open file is possible without contending for locks.  Furthermore, since the
fileReader or fileWriter (and not the file) stores the current file offset, it
is straightforward to create programs that access the same open file in
parallel. Note that such parallel access is not possible in C when multiple
threads are using the same ``FILE*`` to write to different regions of a file
because of the race condition between ``fseek`` and ``fwrite``. Because of these
issues, Chapel programmers wishing to perform I/O will need to know how to open
files as well as create fileReaders and fileWriters.

.. _serialize-deserialize:

The 'serialize' and 'deserialize' Methods
-----------------------------------------

A Chapel program can implement ``serialize`` and ``deserialize`` methods
on a user-defined data type to define how that type is deserialized from a
``fileReader`` or serialized to a ``fileWriter``. The method signatures for
non-class types are:

.. code-block:: chapel

   proc T.serialize(writer: fileWriter(locking=false, ?),
                    ref serializer: ?st) throws

   proc ref T.deserialize(reader: fileReader(locking=false, ?),
                          ref deserializer: ?dt) throws

The signatures for classes are slightly different:

.. code-block:: chapel

   override proc T.serialize(writer: fileWriter(locking=false, ?),
                             ref serializer: ?st) throws

   override proc T.deserialize(reader: fileReader(locking=false, ?),
                               ref deserializer: ?dt) throws

The ``serializer`` and ``deserializer`` arguments must satisfy the
:ref:`Serializer API<io-serializer-API>` and the
:ref:`Deserializer API<io-deserializer-API>`, respectively.

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

Implementations of ``serialize`` and ``deserialize`` methods are not
necessarily required to utilize their ``serializer`` and ``deserializer``
arguments, and can instead trivially read and write from their ``fileReader``
and ``fileWriter`` arguments. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  // A record 'R' that serializes as an integer
  record R : writeSerializable {
    var x : int;

    proc serialize(writer: fileWriter(locking=false, ?),
                   ref serializer: ?st) {
      writer.write(x);
    }
  }

  var val = new R(5);
  writeln(val); // prints '5'

Using Serializers and Deserializers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Serializers<io-serializer-user-API>` and
:ref:`Deserializers<io-deserializer-user-API>` support a variety of methods
to support serializing various kinds of types. These methods can be used
to serialize or deserialize a type in a format-agnostic way. For example,
consider a simple 'point' type:

.. code-block:: chapel

  record point : writeSerializable {
    var x : int;
    var y : int;
  }

The default implementation of ``point``'s ``serialize`` method will naturally
serialize ``point`` as a record. In the default serialization format, this
would look something like ``(x = 2, y = 4)``. In the JSON serialization format,
the output would instead be ``{"x":4, "y":2}``. While this may be perfectly
acceptable, what if the author of ``point`` wished to always serialize a
``point`` as a tuple?

Serializers and Deserializers have "start" methods that begin serialization
or deserialization of a type, and then return a helper object that implements
methods to continue the process. To begin serializing ``point`` as a tuple,
a user may invoke the ``startTuple`` method on the ``serializer``, passing in
the ``fileWriter`` to use when writing serialized output and the number of
elements in the tuple. The returned value from ``startTuple`` is a helper
object that implements ``writeElement`` and ``endTuple`` methods:

.. code-block:: chapel

    proc point.serialize(writer: fileWriter(locking=false, ?),
                         ref serializer: ?st) {
      // Start serializing and get the helper object
      // '2' represents the number of tuple elements to be serialized
      var ser = serializer.startTuple(writer, 2);

      ser.writeElement(x); // serialize 'x' as a tuple element
      ser.writeElement(y); // serialize 'y' as a tuple element

      // End serialization of the tuple
      ser.endTuple();
    }

Now, when using different Serializers like the :type:`~IO.defaultSerializer` or
the :type:`~JSON.jsonSerializer`, the ``point`` type can be serialized without
introducing special cases for each format:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO, JSON;

  var p = new point(4, 2);

  // Prints '(4, 2)' in the default serialization format
  stdout.writeln(p);

  // Prints '[4, 2]' in the JSON serialization format
  var jsonWriter = stdout.withSerializer(jsonSerializer);
  jsonWriter.writeln(p);

A similar API exists for deserialization that would allow for deserializing a
``point`` as a tuple. Please refer to the
:ref:`IO Serializers technote<ioSerializers>` for more detail on the various
kinds of types that can be serialized and deserialized. As of Chapel 1.32 the
supported type-kinds are Classes, Records, Tuples, Arrays, Lists, and Maps.

.. _about-io-generated-default-methods:

Compiler-Generated Default Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default ``serialize`` methods are created for all types for which a
user-defined ``serialize`` method is not provided.

Classes will be serialized as a 'Class' type-kind using the Serializer API,
and will invoke their parent ``serialize`` method before serializing their
own fields.

Records will be serialized as a 'Record' type-kind using the Serializer API,
and will serialize each field in the record.

Default ``deserialize`` methods are created for all types for which a
user-defined ``deserialize`` method is not provided.  The default
``deserialize`` methods will mirror the relevant API calls in the default
``serialize`` methods.

For more information on the default serialization format, please refer to the
:type:`~IO.defaultSerializer` and :type:`~IO.defaultDeserializer` types.

If the compiler sees a user-defined implementation of the ``serialize`` method,
the ``deserialize`` method, or the deserializing initializer, then the compiler
may choose to not automatically generate any of the other unimplemented
methods. This is out of concern that the user has intentionally deviated from
the default implementation of serialization and deserialization.

Types with compiler-generated versions of these methods do not need to
explicitly indicate that they satisfy any of the relevant serialization
interfaces (such as ``writeSerializable``).

.. note::

  Note that it is not currently possible to read and write circular
  data structures with these mechanisms.

.. _about-io-files:

Files
-----

There are several functions that open a file and return a :record:`file`
including :proc:`open`, :proc:`openTempFile`, :proc:`openMemFile`, the
:record:`file` initializer that takes an ``int`` argument, and the
:record:`file` initializer that takes a :type:`~CTypes.c_FILE` argument.

Once a file is open, it is necessary to create associated fileReader(s) and/or
fileWriter(s) - see :proc:`file.reader` and :proc:`file.writer` - to read from
and/or write to the file.

Use the :proc:`file.fsync` function to explicitly synchronize the file to
ensure that file data is committed to the file's underlying device for
persistence.

Files, fileReaders, and fileWriters will be kept alive while there are variables
referring to them and closed when all variables referring to them have gone out
of scope.  However, each can be closed explicitly with ``close`` methods.  Note
that :proc:`file.close` will not work if the file has open fileReaders and/or
fileWriters.

 .. note::

    :ref:`Escaped strings <string.nonunicode>` can be used for paths on systems
    where UTF-8 file names are not enforced.


.. _about-io-filereader-filewriter-creation:

Functions for fileReader and fileWriter Creation
------------------------------------------------

:proc:`file.writer` creates a :record:`fileWriter` for writing to a file, and
:proc:`file.reader` creates a :record:`fileReader` for reading from a file.

The helper functions :proc:`openReader` and :proc:`openWriter` can also be used
to open a file and create a ``fileReader``/``fileWriter`` to it in a
single step.

.. _about-io-filereader-filewriter-synchronization:

Synchronization of fileReader and fileWriter Data and Avoiding Data Races
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

FileReaders and fileWriters (and files) contain locks in order to keep their
operation safe for multiple tasks. When creating a fileReader or fileWriter, it
is possible to disable the lock (for performance reasons) by passing
``locking=false`` to e.g.  file.writer(), or by using
:proc:`openReader`/:proc:`openWriter`.  Some ``fileReader`` and ``fileWriter``
methods should only be called on locked fileReaders or fileWriters.  With these
methods, it is possible to perform I/O "transactions" (see
:proc:`fileWriter.mark`, e.g.). To use these methods, e.g., first lock the
fileWriter with :proc:`fileWriter.lock`, call the methods you need, then unlock
the fileWriter with :proc:`fileWriter.unlock`. Note that in the future, we may
move to alternative ways of calling these functions that guarantee that they are
not called on a fileReader or fileWriter without the appropriate locking.

Besides data races that can occur if locking is not used in fileWriters when it
should be, it is also possible for there to be data races on file data that is
buffered simultaneously in multiple fileReader/fileWriter combinations.  The
main way to avoid such data races is the :proc:`fileWriter.flush`
synchronization operation.  :proc:`fileWriter.flush` will make all writes to the
fileWriter, if any, available to concurrent viewers of its associated file, such
as other fileWriters, fileReaders or other applications accessing this file
concurrently. See the note below for more details on the situation in which this
kind of data race can occur.

.. note::

  Since fileWriters can buffer data until :proc:`fileWriter.flush` is called, it
  is possible to write programs that have undefined behavior because of race
  conditions on fileWriter buffers. In particular, the problem comes up for
  programs that make:

   * concurrent operations on multiple fileWriters and/or fileReaders that
     operate on overlapping regions of a file
   * where at least one fileWriter is used along with other fileWriters or
     fileReaders
   * and where data could be stored in more than one of the overlapping
     fileWriter's buffers at the same time (i.e., write and read ordering are
     not enforced through :proc:`fileWriter.flush` and other means such as
     sync variables).

  Note that it is possible in some cases to create a :record:`file` that does
  not allow multiple fileWriters and/or fileReaders at different
  offsets. FileWriters created on such files will not change the file's offset
  based on a ``region=`` offset argument. Instead, each read or write operation
  will use the file descriptor's current offset. Therefore, only one
  fileWriter or fileReader should be created for files created in the following
  situations:

    * with the file initializer that takes a :type:`~CTypes.c_FILE` argument
    * with the file initializer that takes an ``int`` argument, where the
      ``int`` represents a non-seekable system file descriptor


Performing I/O with FileReaders and FileWriters
-----------------------------------------------

FileReaders have a variety of read methods and fileWriters have a variety of
write methods. The most common variety of these are generic methods that can
read or write values of any type. For non-primitive types, the relevant
``deserialize`` or ``serialize`` method is used to control the I/O formatting;
see :ref:`serialize-deserialize`. These functions generally take any number of
arguments and `throw` if there was an error:

 * :proc:`fileWriter.write`
 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeln`
 * :proc:`FormattedIO.fileWriter.writef` (see also :ref:`about-io-formatted-io`)
 * :proc:`fileReader.read`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readln`
 * :proc:`FormattedIO.fileReader.readf` (see also :ref:`about-io-formatted-io`)

The ``fileWriter`` type also has the following methods for executing write
operations with more specific types. These methods can provide finer control
over the ``fileWriter``'s behavior as well as some performance advantages over
the generic `write` methods:

 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeBits`
 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeCodepoint`
 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeByte`
 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeString`
 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeBytes`
 * :proc:`fileWriter.writeBinary`

The ``fileReader`` type has similar methods for executing read operations with
more specific types, where the goal of these methods is also to provide finer
control over the ``fileReader``'s behavior and the potential for performance
advantages:

 * :proc:`fileReader.readBits`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readCodepoint`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readByte`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readString`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readBytes`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readBinary`

Additionally, the ``fileReader`` has the following methods which read arbitrary
amounts of data from the file until some stop condition is met. These methods
generally have multiple overloads for reading into values of different types:

 * :proc:`fileReader.readLine`
 * :proc:`fileReader.lines`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readThrough`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readTo`
 * :proc:`fileReader.readAll`

Sometimes it's important to flush the buffer in a fileWriter - to do that, use
the :proc:`fileWriter.flush()` method. Flushing the buffer will make all writes
available to other applications or other views of the file (e.g., it will call
the OS call ``pwrite()``).  It is also possible to close a fileWriter, which
will implicitly flush it and release any buffer memory used by the fileWriter.
Note that if you need to ensure that data from a fileWriter is on disk, you'll
have to call :proc:`fileWriter.flush` or :proc:`fileWriter.close` and then
:proc:`file.fsync` on the related file.

.. _about-io-closing-filereader-filewriter:

Functions for Closing FileReaders and FileWriters
-------------------------------------------------

A fileReader or fileWriter must be closed in order to free the resources
allocated for it, to ensure that data written to it is visible to other
fileReaders, or to allow the associated file to be closed.

See :proc:`fileReader.close` and :proc:`fileWriter.close`.

It is an error to perform any I/O operations on a fileReader or fileWriter
that has been closed.
It is an error to close a file when it has fileReaders and/or fileWriters that
have not been closed.

Files, fileReaders and fileWriters are reference counted. Each file, fileReader
and fileWriter is closed automatically when no references to it remain. For
example, if a local variable is the only reference to a fileReader, the
fileReader will be closed when that variable goes out of scope.  Programs may
also close a file, fileReader or fileWriter explicitly.

.. _stdin-stdout-stderr:

The ``stdin`` fileReader, and ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` fileWriters
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Chapel provides the predefined fileReader :var:`stdin`, and the predefined
fileWriters :var:`stdout`, and :var:`stderr` to access the corresponding
operating system streams standard input, standard output, and standard error.

:var:`stdin` supports reading;
:var:`stdout` and :var:`stderr` support writing.

All three are safe to use concurrently.

Unicode Support
---------------

Most I/O operations default to working with textual data in the UTF-8 encoding.
This choice of UTF-8 matches the encoding used by the ``string`` type (see
:ref:`Chapter-Strings`).

To work with non-UTF-8 data, it's necessary to use binary I/O routines (e.g.
:proc:`fileReader.readByte`, :proc:`fileReader.readBytes`,
:proc:`fileReader.readBinary` :proc:`fileReader.readBits`) or do I/O with a
serializer or deserializer that uses a binary format, such as
:record:`~IO.binaryDeserializer`.

Generally speaking, if invalid UTF-8 is encountered when reading textual data, a
``SystemError`` will be throw with ``EILSEQ`` and the channel position will be
left just after the first byte of UTF-8 that was determined to be invalid. Some
routines have other error handling behavior as described in their documentation
(for example, see :proc:`fileReader.readThrough`).

.. _about-io-error-handling:

Error Handling
--------------

Most I/O routines throw an :class:`~Errors.Error`, which can be handled
appropriately with ``try`` and ``catch`` (see the
:ref:`documentation<Handling_Errors>` for more detail).

Additionally, some subclasses of :class:`~Errors.Error` are commonly used within
the I/O implementation. These are:

 * :class:`OS.EofError` - the end of file was reached
 * :class:`OS.UnexpectedEofError` - a read or write only returned part of the requested data
 * :class:`OS.BadFormatError` - data read did not adhere to the requested format

.. _io-general-sys-error:

**System Errors:**

For other error cases, a general :class:`~OS.SystemError` is typically thrown.
These errors are often produced by less predictable circumstances that are
more challenging to recover from. For example, a :record:`fileReader` could run
out of memory when attempting to allocate more buffer space.

As such, it is typically recommended that more specific errors are caught and
recovered from separately from a ``SystemError``. See the following example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  const r = openReader("test.txt");

  try {
    var i = r.read(int);
    // ...
  } catch e: EofError {
    writeln("r is at EOF");
    // we're done reading

  } catch e: UnexpectedEofError {
    writeln("unable to read an 'int'");
    // try to read something else? ...

  } catch e: SystemError {
    writeln("system error in IO implementation: ", e);
    // try to recover from the error? ...

  } catch e: Error {
    writeln("something else went wrong...");
  }


.. _io-transactions:

I/O Transactions
----------------

An *I/O transaction* is a common pattern afforded by the IO interface that
provides the ability to temporarily hold a particular region of a file in a
:record:`fileReader` or :record:`fileWriter`'s buffer. This allows I/O
operations within that region of the file to easily be undone in the event
of some unexpected data or other errors.

To support *I/O transactions*, each ``fileReader`` and ``fileWriter`` is fitted
with a *mark stack* which contains a series of file offsets. The region of the
file between the minimum and maximum offset on the *mark stack* will always be
retained in the buffer.

The steps of a typical *I/O transaction* are as follows:

* ``mark`` the current file offset with :proc:`fileReader.mark` or
  :proc:`fileWriter.mark`. This pushes the current offset onto the *mark stack*

* do a speculative I/O operation:

    * reading example: read 200 bytes followed by a `b`.
    * writing example: write 200 bytes without exceeding the ``fileWriter``'s
      region.

* if the operation fails, ``revert`` the operation by calling :proc:`fileReader.revert`
  or :proc:`fileWriter.revert`. Subsequent operations will continue from the
  originally marked offset as if nothing happened.

* if the operation is successful, call :proc:`fileReader.commit` or
  :proc:`fileWriter.commit` to pop the value from the *mark stack* and continue
  performing I/O operations from the current offset.

Note that when the mark stack is emptied, a ``fileWriter`` is allowed to flush
any portion of its buffer to its file and a ``fileReader`` is allowed to discard
any portion of its buffer.

See the following example of a simple I/O transaction:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  var fr = openReader("file.txt");

  // mark the current channel position
  fr.mark();

  // read an array of bytes
  var a: [0..<200] uint(8);
  fr.read(a);

  // try to match a pattern
  if fr.matchLiteral("b") {
    fr.commit(); // "b" was found, continue reading from the current offset
  } else {
    fr.revert(); // "b" was't found, revert back to the marked position

    // try to read something else from the file, throw an error, etc.
  }

.. _filereader-filewriter-regions:

Specifying the region of a fileReader or fileWriter
---------------------------------------------------

The :record:`fileReader` and :record:`fileWriter` types can be configured to
own a specific *region* of their associated file.

When a ``fileReader`` or ``fileWriter`` is initialized using one of the
following routines, the optional ``region`` argument can be set to designate
some region of the file (a zero-based :ref:`range<Chapter-Ranges>` of integers
in bytes) that can be read from or written to:

* :proc:`file.reader`
* :proc:`file.writer`
* :proc:`openReader`

I/O operations that fall outside of the *region* are illegal. The ``region``
argument defaults to ``0..``, meaning that the owned region starts at the 0th
byte, and extends indefinitely.

Note that :proc:`fileReader.seek` and :proc:`fileWriter.seek` can be used to
adjust a ``fileReader`` or ``fileWriter``'s region after initialization.

Creating a ``fileReader`` or ``fileWriter`` that points to a sub-region of
a file can be useful for concurrently reading from or writing to multiple
portions of a file from separate tasks. See the following example, which
uses multiple tasks to concurrently read bytes from a binary file into an
array of bytes:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  // the number of tasks to use
  config const nWorkers = 8;

  // open a (large) binary file
  var f = open("file.dat", ioMode.r);

  // compute how many bytes each worker will read
  const nBytes = f.size,
        nPerLoc = nBytes/ nWorkers;

  // create an array to hold the file contents
  var a: [0..<nBytes] uint(8);

  // concurrently read each worker's region into 'a'
  coforall w in 0..<nWorkers {
    const myRegion = (w*nPerLoc)..<((w+1) * nPerLoc),
          fr = f.reader(region=myRegion, locking=false);

    fr.readBinary(a[myRegion]);
  }


.. _locking-filereaders-and-filewriters:

Locking Behavior of FileReaders and FileWriters
-----------------------------------------------

The :record:`fileReader` and :record:`fileWriter` types can be configured to
lock access to their file when executing I/O operations to avoid race conditions
with other ``fileReader`` or ``fileWriter`` instances that may be accessing the
same file.

The ``locking`` field is a ``param`` and is thus part of the ``fileReader``
and ``fileWriter`` type. As such, it is possible to use type constraints to
designate whether a reader or writer is locking. For example this could be
useful in a procedure that relies on a ``reader`` argument being locking:

.. code-block:: chapel

  use IO;

  proc readSomething(reader: fileReader(locking=true, ?)) {
    // use 'reader' concurrently with another fileReader/fileWriter   ...
  }

The ``locking`` field can be set by passing the desired value to one of the
following routines that create a :record:`fileReader` or :record:`fileWriter`:

* :proc:`file.reader`
* :proc:`file.writer`
* :proc:`openReader`
* :proc:`openWriter`

With a locking ``fileReader`` or ``fileWriter``, one can obtain a lock manually
by calling :proc:`fileReader.lock` or :proc:`fileWriter.lock`, and then release
a lock by calling :proc:`fileReader.unlock` or :proc:`fileWriter.unlock`.

.. note::
  The following methods will not automatically acquire/release a lock for
  ``locking=true``:

  * :proc:`fileReader.mark`
  * :proc:`fileWriter.mark`
  * :proc:`fileReader.commit`
  * :proc:`fileWriter.commit`
  * :proc:`fileReader.revert`
  * :proc:`fileWriter.revert`
  * :proc:`fileReader.offset`
  * :proc:`fileWriter.offset`


.. _about-io-ensuring-successful-io:

Ensuring Successful I/O
-----------------------

It is possible - in some situations - for I/O to fail without returning an
error. In cases where a programmer wants to be sure that there was no error
writing the data to disk, it is important to call :proc:`file.fsync` to make
sure that data has arrived on disk without an error. Many errors can be
reported with a typical operation, but some errors can only be reported by the
system during :proc:`file.close` or even :proc:`file.fsync`.

When a file (or fileWriter) is closed, data written to that file will be written
to disk eventually by the operating system. If an application needs to be sure
that the data is immediately written to persistent storage, it should use
:proc:`file.fsync` prior to closing the file.

Correspondence with C I/O
-------------------------

It is not possible to seek, read, or write to a file directly; fileReaders
and/or fileWriters must be created and used.

:proc:`fileWriter.flush` in Chapel has the same conceptual meaning as
``fflush()`` in C.  However, ``fflush()`` is not necessarily called in
:proc:`fileWriter.flush()`, unlike ``fsync()``, which is actually called by
:proc:`file.fsync()` in Chapel.

/* "fileReader" and "fileWriter" I/O contributed by Michael Ferguson

   Future Work:
    - We would like to have a 'serialization' system, including allowing
      the writing of data structures with circular references, and
      encoding the types of classes.
    - Currently, the union tag numbers are per-compile; you could not read
      binary union data written in one Chapel program with another. This problem
      will also apply to class tag numbers once we start encoding types.
    - The Chapel compiler does not currently allow RAII/reference counting
      to work correctly in all cases (bug report 'records containing pointers'
      and test files in test/users/ferguson/{byvalue.chpl,refcnt.chpl};
      as a result, current code might need to close fileReaders, fileWriters,
      and files explicitly and/or sharing of fileReaders, fileWriters and files
      between variables might not work correctly.
    - FileReaders and fileWriters have a lock, and some methods on a fileReader
      or fileWriter only make sense when the lock is held. In the future (again,
      once RAII makes sense), we might replace this with 'get locked fileWriter'
      that returns a different type that has the methods that can only be used
      on a locked fileWriter, e.g..
    - The error handling strategy here is a bit awkward for the library-writer
      (not so much for the user). A broader exceptions strategy would help
      quite a bit - and some of these interfaces will change when that happens.
    - Fancy features, like adding a bytes or buffer object to a fileReader or
      fileWriter (so that the fileReader or fileWriter just refers to it and
      does not copy it) are implemented but not well tested.
    - Cleaning up to reduce the number of exported symbols, and using enums for
      all constants once 'use enum' is available and we have a way to get
      C constants into Chapel enums.
    - Support for libevent/qthreads system call thread so that we have
      something suitable for writing (in a straightforward manner) a
      multithreaded webserver
    - Doing something reasonable with a file that moves from one node to
      another - namely, when a fileReader or fileWriter is created with a file
      that resides remotely, if that same file is accessible locally (e.g. with
      Lustre or NFS), we should open a local copy of that file and use that in
      the fileReader or fileWriter. (not sure how to avoid opening # fileReader/
      fileWriter copies of these files
      -- seems that we'd want some way to cache that...).

  This is an alternative way to create a :record:`file`.  The main way to do so

  reading or writing to a file opened using this initializer.

Create a Chapel file that works with a system file descriptor.  Note that once
the file is open, you will need to use a :proc:`file.reader` to create a
fileReader or :proc:`file.writer` to create a fileWriter to actually perform I/O
operations

.. note::

  This is an alternative way to create a :record:`file`.  The main way to do so
  is via the :proc:`open` function.

The system file descriptor will be closed when the Chapel file is closed.

.. note::

  This function can be used to create Chapel files that refer to system file
  descriptors that do not support the ``seek`` functionality. For example, file
  descriptors that represent pipes or open socket connections have this
  property. In that case, the resulting file value should only be used with one
  :record:`fileReader` or :record:`fileWriter` at a time.  The I/O system will
  ignore the fileReader offsets when reading (or the fileWriter offsets when
  writing) to files backed by non-seekable file descriptors.


:arg fileDescriptor: a system file descriptor.
:arg hints: optional argument to specify any hints to the I/O system about
            this file. See :record:`ioHintSet`.
:arg own: set to indicate if the `fileDescriptor` provided should be cleaned up
          when the ``file`` is closed.  Defaults to ``false``

  Read a line into an array of bytes.

  Reads bytes from the :record:`fileReader` until a ``\n`` is reached. Values
  are read in binary format (i.e., this method is not aware of UTF-8 encoding).

  The array's size is not changed to accommodate bytes. If a newline is not
  found before the array is filled, or ``maxSize`` bytes are read, a
  :class:`~OS.BadFormatError` is thrown and the ``fileReader`` offset is
  returned to the position it had when this routine was called.

  :arg a: A 1D DefaultRectangular non-strided array storing ``int(8)`` or
          ``uint(8)``. Values are overwritten.
  :arg maxSize: The maximum number of bytes to store into the ``a`` array.
                Defaults to the size of the array.

                     ``true``, the newline isn't counted in the number of
                     bytes read.
  :returns: The number of array elements set by this call, or ``0`` otherwise
            (i.e., the ``fileReader`` was already at EOF).

  :throws IllegalArgumentError: If ``maxSize > a.size``
  :throws BadFormatError: If the line is longer than ``maxSize``. The
                          fileReader's offset is not moved in that case.

.. _about-io-formatted-io:

Formatted I/O
-------------

See below for a :ref:`sample-based overview <about-io-formatted-io-overview>`
of the format strings. Further below, we describes the format string syntax
:ref:`in detail <about-io-formatted-io-in-detail>`. Finally, we demonstrate the
functionality with :ref:`example function calls
<about-io-formatted-io-examples>`.

.. _about-io-formatted-io-overview:

Overview of Format Strings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In a manner similar to C's 'printf' and 'scanf', the IO package includes
:proc:`fileWriter.writef` and :proc:`fileReader.readf` functions. These
functions take in a format string and some arguments. The :proc:`string.format`
method is also available and is loosely equivalent to C's 'sprintf'. For
example, one might do:

.. code-block:: chapel

  writef("My favorite %s is %i\n", "number", 7);

  var s:string = "My favorite %s is %i".format("number", 7);
  writeln(s);

  // prints:
  // My favorite number is 7
  // My favorite number is 7

The following sections offer a tour through the conversions to illustrate the
common cases. A more precise definition follows in the
:ref:`about-io-formatted-io-in-detail` section below.

In this file, we use "integral" to refer to the Chapel types int or uint and
"floating-point" to refer to real, imaginary, or complex, of any bit width.

Formatted I/O for C Programmers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This table is designed to help C programmers understand the equivalent
Chapel format specifiers.

========  ===========  ==========================================
C         Chapel       Meaning
========  ===========  ==========================================
%i        %i           a signed integer in decimal
%d        %i           a signed integer in decimal
%u        %u           an unsigned integer in decimal
%x        %xu          an unsigned integer in hexadecimal
%g        %r           real number in exponential or decimal (if compact)
%7.2g     %7.2r        real, 2 significant digits, padded to 7 columns
%f        %dr          real number always in decimal
%7.3f     %7.3dr       real, 3 digits after ``.``, padded to 7 columns
%e        %er          real number always in exponential
%7.3e     %7.3er       real, 3 digits after ``.``, padded to 7 columns
%s        %s           a string without any quoting
========  ===========  ==========================================

Unlike in C, a value of the wrong type will be cast appropriately - so for
example printing 2 (an ``int``) with ``%.2dr`` will result in ``2.00``.  Note
that Chapel's ``%n`` and ``%?`` are equivalent to ``%r`` for real conversions
and ``%i`` for numeric conversions; so these are also equivalent to ``%i``
``%d`` or ``%g`` in C. Also note that Chapel format strings include many
capabilities not available with C formatted I/O routines - including quoted
strings, binary numbers, and complex numbers.


Generic Numeric Conversions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``%{##.###}``
  decimal number padded on the left with spaces to 2 digits before
  the point, rounded to 3 after. Works with integral, real, imaginary,
  or complex arguments.

  In all cases, the output is padded on the left to the total length
  of the conversion specifier (6 in this example).  The output
  can be longer, when needed to accommodate the number.

``%{#####}``
  integral value padded out to 5 digits. Also works with real, imaginary
  or complex numbers by rounding them to integers. Numbers with more
  digits will take up more space instead of being truncated.

In both conversions above, an imaginary argument gets an 'i' afterwards
and the entire expression is padded out to the width of ##### digits.
For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  writef("|%{#####}|\n", 2.0i);
       // outputs:
       //   |   2i|

  writef("|%{#####.#}|\n", 2.0i);
       // outputs:
       //   |   2.0i|

Complex arguments are printed in the format a + bi, where each of a and b is
rounded individually as if printed under that conversion on its own. Then, the
formatted complex number is padded to the requested size. For example:

.. code-block:: chapel

  writef("|%{#########}|\n", 1.0+2.0i);
       // outputs:
       //   |   1 + 2i|

  writef("|%{#########.#}|\n", 1.0+2.0i);
       // outputs:
       //   | 1.0 + 2.0i|

See :ref:`about-io-formatted-pound-details` for more details
on this conversion type.

``%n``
  a "number" - equivalent to one of %i, %u, %r, %m, or %z below,
  depending on the type

``%17n``
  a number padded out to 17 columns

``%.4n``
  a number with 4 significant digits or a precision of 4

Integral Conversions
++++++++++++++++++++

``%i`` or ``%di``
  a signed integer in decimal, possibly negative
  (note - when reading an ``%i``, ``-`` is allowed)
``%u`` or ``%du``
  an unsigned decimal integer
  (note - when reading a ``%u``, ``-`` is not allowed)
``%bi``
 a binary signed integer
``%bu``
 a binary unsigned integer
``%@bu``
 a binary unsigned integer prefixed with ``0b``
``%oi``
 an octal signed integer
``%ou``
 an octal unsigned integer
``%@ou``
 an octal unsigned integer prefixed with ``0o``
``%xu``
 a hexadecimal unsigned integer
``%xi``
 a hexadecimal signed integer
``%@xu``
 a hexadecimal unsigned integer prefixed with ``0x``
``%Xu``
 a hexadecimal unsigned integer in uppercase
``%@Xu``
 a hexadecimal unsigned integer prefixed with ``0X`` and uppercase
``%17i``
 a decimal integer padded on the left with spaces to 17 columns
 (That is, it is right-justified in a 17-column field.
 Padding width is ignored when reading integers)
``%*i``
 as with ``%17i`` but read the minimum width from the preceding argument
``%017i``
 a decimal integer padded on the left with zeros to 17 columns
``%<17i``
 a decimal integer left-justified (padded on the right) to 17 columns
``%^17i``
 a decimal integer center-justified (padded equally on the left and right) to 17 columns
``%>17i``
 a decimal integer right-justified (padded on the left) to 17 columns — equivalent to ``%17i``
``%+i``
 a decimal integer showing ``+`` for positive numbers
``% i``
 a decimal integer with a space for positive numbers

Real Conversions
++++++++++++++++

``%r``
 a real number with decimal or exponential notation, where
 exponential is chosen if the decimal version would be too long

``%6r``
 as with ``%r`` but padded on the left to 6 columns (i.e., right-justified)
``%<6r``
 as with ``%r`` but padded on the right to 6 columns (i.e., left-justified)
``%^6r``
 as with ``%r`` but padded equally on the left and right to 6 columns (i.e., center-justified)
``%>6r``
 equivalent to ``%6r``
``%.4r``
 as with ``%r`` but with 4 significant digits
``%.*r``
 as with ``%.4r`` but with significant digits read from preceding argument
``%6.4r``
 as with ``%r`` but padded on the left to 6 columns
 and with 4 significant digits
``%*.*r``
 as with ``%6.4r`` but read minimum width and significant digits from
 preceding arguments

 a real number in decimal notation, e.g. ``12.34``
``%6dr``
 a decimal number padded on the left to 6 columns (right-justified)
``%.4dr``
 a decimal number with 4 digits after the radix point
``%6.4dr``

 after the radix point
 (width and precision are ignored when reading numbers in readf)

``%er``

``%Er``
 like %er but with the 'e' in uppercase, e.g. ``8.2E-23``
``%.4er``
 exponential notation with 4 digits after the period, e.g. ``8.2000e-23``

``%xer``
 hexadecimal number using p to mark exponent e.g. ``6c.3f7p-2a``

Complex and Imaginary Conversions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``%m``
 an imaginary number, like a real with ``%r`` but ends with an ``i``

``%z``
 print complex number with ``%r`` for each part in the format ``a + bi``
``%@z``
 print complex number with ``%r`` for each part in the format ``(a,b)``
``%6z``
 as with ``%z`` but pad the entire complex number out to 6 columns
``%6.4z``
 print a and b 4 significant digits and pad the entire complex
 number out to 6 columns
``%dz``
 print a and b with ``%dr`` (using decimal notation)
``%ez``
 print a and b with ``%er`` (using exponential notation)

String and Bytes Conversions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

``%s``
 a string. When reading, read until whitespace.
 Note that if you want to be able to read your string back in,
 you should use one of the quoted or encoded binary versions (see below),
 since generally with %s it's not clear where the string ends.
``%c``
 a single Unicode character (argument should be a string or an integral
 storing the character code)
``%17s``
  * when writing - a string left padded (right justified) to 17 columns
  * when reading - read up to 17 bytes or a whitespace, whichever comes
    first, rounding down to whole characters
``%<17s``
  * when writing - a string right padded (left justified) to 17 columns
``%^17s``
  * when writing - a string equally left and right padded (center justified) to 17 columns
``%>17s``
  * when writing - a string left padded (right justified) to 17 columns
  * when reading - read up to 17 bytes or a whitespace, whichever comes
    first, rounding down to whole characters
``%.17s``
 * when writing - a string truncated to 17 columns. When combined
   with quoting strings, for example ``%.17"S``, the conversion
   will print ... after a string if it was truncated. The
   truncation includes leaving room for the quotes and -
   if needed - the periods, so the shortest truncated
   string is ``""...``  Generally, you won't be able to read
   these back in.
 * when reading - read exactly 17 Unicode codepoints
``%"S``
 use double-quotes to delimit string
``%'S``
 use single-quotes to delimit string
``%cS``
 use any character (c) to delimit string
``%{(S)}``
 quoted string, starting with ``(``, ending with ``)``, where the
 parens could be replaced by arbitrary characters
``%*S``
 quoted string, the arg before the string to specifies quote character

``%/a+/``
 where any regular expression can be used instead of ``a+``
 consume one or more 'a's when reading, gives an error when printing,
 and does not assign to any arguments
 (note - regular expression support is dependent on RE2 build;
 see :mod:`Regex`)

``%/(a+)/``
 consume one or more 'a's and then set the corresponding string
 argument to the read value

``%17/a+/``
 match a regular expression up to 17 bytes
 (note that ``%.17/a+/``, which would mean to match 17 characters,
 is not supported).

``%/*/``
 next argument contains the regular expression to match

.. (comment) the above started a nested comment, so here we end it */

General Conversion
++++++++++++++++++

``%?``
  Use the :record:`~IO.fileWriter`/:record:`~IO.fileReader`'s associated
  serializer/deserializer to write or read a value.

  For example, read and write a record in JSON format:

  .. code-block:: chapel

        use IO, JSON;

        record R {
          // fields...
        }

        var f = open("data.json", ioMode.cwr),
            r: R;

        // write an 'R' in JSON format
        f.writer(serializer = new jsonSerializer()).writef("%?", new R(/* ... */));

        // read into an 'R' from JSON format
        f.reader(deserializer = new jsonDeserializer()).readf("%?", r);

Note About Whitespace
+++++++++++++++++++++

When reading, ``\n`` in a format string matches any zero or more space
characters other than newline and then exactly one newline character. In
contrast, ``" "`` matches at least one space character of any kind.

When writing, whitespace is printed from the format string just like any
other literal would be.

Finally, space characters after a revcom will be ignored, so
that a binary format string can appear more readable.

.. _about-io-formatted-io-in-detail:

Format String Syntax in Detail
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Chapel's format strings are simpler than those in C in one way: it is no longer
necessary to specify the types of the arguments in the format string. For
example, in C the l in %ld is specifying the type of the argument for integer
(decimal) conversion. That is not necessary in Chapel since the compiler is
able to use type information from the call.

Format strings in Chapel consist of:

 * conversion specifiers e.g. ``"%xi"`` (described below)
 * newline e.g. ``"\n"``

   * when writing - prints a newline
   * when reading - reads any amount of non-newline whitespace and then
     exactly one newline. Causes the format string not to
     match if it did not read a newline.

 * other whitespace e.g. ``" "``

    * when writing - prints as the specified whitespace
    * when reading - matches at least one character of whitespace, possibly
      including newlines.

 * other text e.g. "test"

    * when writing - prints the specified text
    * when reading - matches the specified text

.. _about-io-formatted-pound-details:

# Specifiers
++++++++++++

All # specifiers must be enclosed in ``%{}`` syntax, for example ``%{#}`` is the
shortest one, and ``%{#.#}`` is a more typical one. The integer portion of the
number will be padded out to match the number of ``#`` s before the decimal
point, and the number of ``#`` s after the decimal point indicate how many
digits to print after the decimal point. In other words, display how many
digits to use when printing a floating-point number by using the # symbol to
stand for digits. The fractional portion of the number will be rounded
appropriately and extra space will be made if the integer portion is too small:

.. code-block:: chapel

  writef("n:%{###.###}\n", 1.2349);
       // outputs:
       // n:  1.235

This syntax also works for numbers without a decimal point by rounding them
appropriately.

A # specifier may start with a ``.``.

.. code-block:: chapel

  writef("%{.##}\n", 0.777);
       // outputs:
       //  0.78

% Specifiers
++++++++++++

Specifiers starting with % offer quite a few options. First, some basic
rules.

``%%``
 means a literal ``%``
``\n``
 means a literal newline
``\\``
 means a single backslash
``%{}``
 curly braces can wrap a ``%`` or ``#`` conversion specifier. That way, even
 odd specifiers can be interpreted unambiguously. Some of the more complex
 features require the use of the ``%{}`` syntax, but it's always
 acceptable to use curly braces to make the format string clearer.
 Curly braces are required for # conversion specifiers.

In general, a ``%`` specifier consists of either text or binary conversions:

::

 [optional flags]
 [optional field width or size in bytes]
 [optional . then precision]
 [optional base flag]
 [optional exponential type]
 [conversion type]

Going through each section for text conversions:


[optional flags]
  ``@``
   means "alternate form". It means to print out a base when not using
   decimal (e.g. ``0xFFF`` or ``0b101011``); and it will format a complex
   number with parens instead of as e.g. ``1.0+2.0i``
  ``+``
   means to show a plus sign when printing positive numbers
  ``0``
   means to pad numeric conversions with 0 instead of space
  ``" "``
   (a space) leaves a blank before a positive number
   (in order to help line up with negative numbers)
  ``<``
   left-justify the converted value instead of right-justifying.
   Note, if both ``0`` and ``<`` are given, the effect is as if only ``<``
   were given.
  ``^``
   center-justify the converted value instead of right-justifying. Note, if
   both ``0`` and ``^`` are given, zero-padding will only be applied to the
   left of the numerical value
  ``>``
   explicitly denote right-justification


[optional field width]
   When printing numeric or string values, the field width specifies the number
   of *columns* that the conversion should use to display the value. It can be
   ``*``, which means to read the field width from an integral argument before
   the converted value.

   For string conversions in readf (``%s`` ``%"`` ``%'`` ``%//``), the field
   width specifies the maximum number of bytes to read.

   For numeric conversions in readf, the field width is ignored.

[optional . then precision]
   When printing floating point values, the precision is used to control
   the number of decimal digits to print.  For ``%r`` conversions, it
   specifies the number of significant digits to print; for ``%dr`` or ``%er``
   conversions, it specifies the number of digits following the decimal point.
   It can also be ``*``, which means to read the precision from an integral
   argument before the converted value.

   For textual string conversions in writef, (``%s`` ``%"`` ``%'``), the
   precision indicates the maximum number of columns to print - and the result
   will be truncated if it does not fit. In readf for these textual string
   conversions, the precision indicates the maximum number of characters
   (e.g. Unicode codepoints) to input.

   Providing a precision argument to an integral specifier (``%i``, ``%u``, etc)
   will emit a warning. Using ``%n`` to specify precision for an integer is
   preferred.

   The precision is silently ignored for for ``%//`` conversions.

[optional base flag]
   ``d``
    means decimal (and not exponential for floating-point)
   ``x``
    means lower-case hexadecimal
   ``X``
    means upper-case hexadecimal
   ``o``
    means octal
   ``b``
    means binary
   ``j``
    means JSON-style strings, numbers, and structures
   ``h``
    means Chapel-style strings, numbers, and structures
   ``'``
    means single-quoted string (with \\ and \')
   ``"``
    means double-quoted string (with \\ and \")

[optional exponential type]
   ``e``
    means floating-point conversion printing exponential ``-12.34e+56``
   ``E``
    means floating-point conversion printing uppercase
    exponential ``-12.34E+56``

[conversion type]
   ``n``
    means type-based number, allowing width and precision (size is not
    mandatory)
   ``i``
    means integral conversion. Note that the size is mandatory for binary
    integral conversions
   ``u``
    means unsigned integral conversion. Note that the size is mandatory for
    binary integral conversions
   ``r``
    means real conversion (e.g. ``12.23``). Note that the size is mandatory for
    binary real conversions
   ``m``
    means imaginary conversion with an ``i`` after it (e.g. ``12.23i``)
   ``z``
    means complex conversion. Note that the size is mandatory for binary complex
    conversions
   ``s``
    means string conversion
   ``S``
    means a quoted string conversion
   ``{cS}``
    means string conversion with quote char *c*
   ``{*S}``
    means string conversion with quote char in argument before the string
   ``{xSy}``
    means string conversion with left and right quote chars *x* and *y*
   ``/.../``
    means a regular expression (for reading only)
   ``{/.../xyz}``
    means regular expression with flags *xyz*
   ``c``
    means a Unicode character - either the first character in a string
    or an integral character code
