*                                                                             *
* This class is designed to provide an accurate and reasonably detailed view  *
* of the way time is being spent within the compiler.  The intent is to       *
* account for all of the time between the entry point to main() and the final *
* call to clean_exit(0) in driver.cpp.                                        *
*                                                                             *
* a) Create a Timer object that will record the wall time as early in the     *
*    compiler as possible                                                     *
*                                                                             *
* b) Use the Timer to determine the elapsed time between the start of the     *
*    program and the start of each phase                                      *
*                                                                             *
* c) Compute the elapsed time for each phase                                  *
*                                                                             *
* d) Stop the timer and generate one or more reports on the time spent in     *
*    each phase.
*                                                                             *
* Every phase has a descriptive name that will be used by the reports.        *
*                                                                             *
* The main loop for the compiler, in runpasses.cpp, has a notion of a "pass"  *
* consists of three phases;                                                   *
*                                                                             *
*    1) The primary computation                                               *
*    2) An optional verify / check phase                                      *
*    3) An AST cleanup phase                                                  *
*                                                                             *
* The tracker collects the sub-phases and reports the overall time in terms   *
* of these passes.  Phases that occur before and after the Passes ignore      *
* the check and clean phases.                                                 *
*                                                                             *
