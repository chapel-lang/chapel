    * If LOOKUP_IMPORT_AND_USE is set, looks for symbols from use/import

    * If LOOKUP_PARENTS is set, looks for symbols from parent scopes (but not
      parent modules of a module) including looking for declarations and
      handling imports, and including finding declarations in the root module.
    * If LOOKUP_TOPLEVEL is set, checks for a toplevel module with this name.

      match.
