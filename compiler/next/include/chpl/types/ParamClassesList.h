// This file lists the Param subclasses to help with macros generating code
// for each.
//
// The arguments are (name of field and tag, type of field, type expr)
//
// the following comment disables doxygen for these
/// \cond DO_NOT_DOCUMENT

PARAM_NODE(BoolParam, bool)
PARAM_NODE(ComplexParam, ComplexDouble)
PARAM_NODE(IntParam, int64_t)
PARAM_NODE(NoneParam, NoneValue)
PARAM_NODE(RealParam, double)
PARAM_NODE(StringParam, UniqueString)
PARAM_NODE(UintParam, uint64_t)
// ImagParam doesn't exist (use RealParam with type ImagType)
// CStringParam, BytesParam don't exist (use StringParam with appropriate type)

/// \endcond

// this comment seems to be necessary for doxygen xml output to be well-formed
