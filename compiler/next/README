This directory contains a start towards work on the revamped compiler.
This directory uses a different directory structure from the old compiler
- see below for rationale.

For now, this work is being done in this directory but the expectation is
that eventually it will swap places with the compiler/ directory (so any
old-compiler code still used is put into subdirectories according to the
organization described below).

Part of improving the compiler will involve adjusting the directory
structure used to store sources and headers. This addresses three problems:

 1. it's not always clear where to find a header/source file - the
    convention varies within the compiler
 2. the current structure is not compatible with refactoring the compiler
    into a library and multiple tools using that library
 3. the current structure makes namespacing harder

### current structure (old compiler structure)

The current structure is to
 * separate out the .cpp files into subdirectories by topic (AST,
   resolution, optimizations). These are currently stored under
   `compiler` so, for example, we have `compiler/AST`.
 * store all include files used by multiple topics in `compiler/include`.
 * store include files used only within a single topic within that topic
   directory. For example, we have some header files in
   `compiler/resolution`.

### proposed structure (new compiler structure)

I'm proposing that we generally try to follow the LLVM project's
directory structure. The structure (for each LLVM project) is this:
 * For code that goes into the library:
   * store .cpp files in `lib/<topic>`
   * store C++ `.h` files forming the library API into
     `include/<project-name>/ and C API `.h` files (if any) in
     `include/<project-name>-c/`. Header files that are relevant to a
     particular topic go into `include/<project-name>/<topic>` and almost
     all header files go into these topic subdirectories. The
     <project-name> here is something like 'chpl' for us and this just
     makes it so that the headers included have the same path as if they
     were installed in e.g. `/usr/include`. So you can have e.g.
     #include "chpl/AST/BlockStmt.h".
   * store `.h` files that are for use only within the project in
     `lib/<topic>`
   * For example, within the LLVM project there is
     `include/llvm/Analysis/AliasAnalysis.h` and
     `llvm/lib/Analysis/AliasAnalysis.cpp`.

 * For code that does not go into a library and only supports a tool,
   store it in `tool/<tool-name>`. For example, there is an LLVM tool
   called `opt` and the sources for it are stored in `tools/opt`.

In particular, for our project, I would expect we end up with this structure:
```
  runtime/ (could also be called chpl-rt/ in the future)
  compiler/  (could also be called chpl/ in the future)
     include/chpl
       uast/ (new AST headers forming library API will go here)
       (nothing from the old compiler since it does not present a library interface)
       
     lib/
       uast/ (new AST source code)
       oast/ (current AST source code and headers)
       resolution/ (resolution code as well as resolution.h)
       ...
  
     tools/
        chpl/
          include/ (current contents of compiler/include)
          AST/ (current contents of compiler/AST)
          ...
          main/.cpp files implementing (source code only used in `chpl` and not in compiler-as-a-library - could contain contents of `compiler/main` today)
```

Please note that when we `#include` a header we will do so assuming that
`chpl/include` is in the `-I` path and also the current `lib` subdir.


### a note about namespaces

It is a style matter to decide when to introduce a new namespace.
Here is some guidance about when to do so:
 * when creating a bunch of similar types that we'd like to be able to
   easily distinguish (e.g. uast vs old ast)
 * when creating a bunch of free functions that we'd like to be able to
   bundle since they are related

In particular, all topic directories need to have a namespace.
