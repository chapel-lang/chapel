COMMON PITFALLS WITH DOXYGEN (THAT BREAK THE DOCS BUILD)

Whenever you run into a Doxygen problem that breaks the docs build,
make sure to explain what you did to fix it here.

---
ERROR: "WARNING: cpp: identifier reference target not found
---

Doxygen will fail to resolve:

  - C++ standard library types (that are not builtin, e.g. `int64_t`)
  - Any `compiler/next` types that are generated by macros (for now)
  - C++11 "in-class member initializers" for enum fields

Just add these types to `$CHPL_HOME/doc/util/nitpick_ignore`.

An "in-class member initializer" for a field looks like:

  `WhereClauseResult whereClauseResult = WHERE_TBD;`

Doxygen can't seem to resolve these when the RHS is an enum.

---
"WARNING: Invalid C++ declaration: Expected end of definition."

Often followed by code like:

  `template<> MostSpecificCandidates >`
  `template<typename A, typename B> pair< A, B > >`

These are usually the definitions of `update()` functions that are
used by the query system. They are heavily templated. Just put the
function inside a DO_NOT_DOCUMENT block like so:

  /// \cond DO_NOT_DOCUMENT
  template<> struct update<resolution::ResolvedExpression> {
    bool operator()(resolution::ResolvedExpression& keep,
                    resolution::ResolvedExpression& addin) const {
      return defaultUpdate(keep, addin);
    }
  };
  /// \endcond

These probably aren't worth figuring out how to fix, and they don't
really need documentation anyway.
