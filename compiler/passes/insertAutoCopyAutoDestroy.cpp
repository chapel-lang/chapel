//# Inserts copy-constructor and destructor calls as needed, by tracking the
//# "ownership" of record objects.
//#
//# Ownership represents the "liveness" of a record object in the sense that it
//# may contain heap-allocated data.  After a record object is constructed, any
//# of its fields of class type may refer to a class object.  In that state, any
//# heap-allocated fields in the record are "owned" by the record.  Calling the
//# destructor for that record type gives the record author the opportunity to
//# clean up any contained class fields and thereby avoid leaking memory.  After
//# the destructor is called, the record variable no longer owns any
//# heap-allocated data.  Reads of that record -- especially to class objects
//# it contains will yield unpredictable results, so the record object is
//# effectively "dead" after it is destroyed.
//#
//# Ownership of a record can also be transferred by a bit-wise copy.  When a
//# bit-wise copy of a record is made, class fields (which are implemented as
//# pointers) are copied verbatim.  That means that both record objects point to
//# the same class data.  The two copies are effectively the same object,
//# residing at two distinct locations in memory.  Ownership is then shared
//# between them.  Some time before both copies go out of scope, one of them
//# needs to call its destructor, the other should not (to avoid
//# double-deletion errors).
//#
//# When ownership is shared in this way, we can perform a sort of internal
//# reference-counting, maintaining a list of aliases, and ensuring that the
//# destructor is called on one of them before the last member of that alias set
//# goes out of scope. 
//#
//# For these purposes, we assume that none of the class fields of an alias is
//# updated, so they remain equivalent throughout.  If that is not true, then
//# the two variables represent independent variables.  In that case, a
//# copy-constructor call should have been inserted because each variable should
//# have its own initialization.  Thus, its absence would indicate an error
//# somewhere upstream.
//#
//# We assume that the input AST contains the minimum number of
//# copy-constructor calls required to provide the specified semantics.  That
//# is, record values passed by in intent must be copied.  We do not yet
//# attempt to pass ownership of an object into a called routine.
//# Variables whose ownersihp must be true before exiting a routine are:
//#  - The return value variable
//#  - A module-level variable.
//#  - A record field in a record.
//# If ownership of any of these is false when they (or their container) is
//# about to go out of scope, a copy must be made to bring ownership to the
//# expected state.  Otherwise, ownership may be shared and a copy potentially
//# avoided. 
//#
//# After copy-constructor calls have been added, the routine has its full
//# complement of constructor calls.  Correct AMM is then just a matter of
//# inserting the minimum number of destructor calls to drive the ownership of
//# all local variables to false before their respective scopes are exited.
//#
//#############################################################################

// In its simplest form, the algorithm for inserting autocopies and
// autodestroys is just a matter of ensuring that each producer (of ownership)
// has a matching consumer within the same function.  
//
// At each place where ownership is required (i.e. the call is a consumer), the
// ownership state of the symbol being consumed is tested.  If true, then the
// code is fine as-is; otherwise, an autoCopy is inserted so a new, owned copy
// of the symbol is passed to the consumer.
//
// If a symbol survives to the end of its scope without being consumed, then an
// autoDestroy is inserted.  One way or another, every owned symbol must be
// consumed before the routine exits.
//
// One important constraint complicates this model: It is not permissible for a
// symbol that is consumed to be used later in its scope.  That is, for an owned
// variable to be consumed, that consumer must coincide with the last use of
// that symbol.  For consumers that precede the last use, an autocopy must be
// inserted between the symbol and its use.
//
// Also, a symbol that is owned on one path into a join node must be owned on
// all paths.  I think this only happens for the return value variable.
// All user variables are initialized close to their points of declaration --
// so they are already owned on all paths.  Arguments are not owned, but they
// are also never directly assigned to.  Regardless, a bitwise copy of a symbol
// (in one clique) into another symbol (in a different clique) is considered to
// be a consumer of the RHS and a producer of the LHS.  If the RHS is unowned
// at that point, an autocopy will be inserted.  By artificially forcing the
// RVV to be in a clique by itself, we can ensure that it will be owned
// irrespective of the path taken.  [This extra complexity can be removed after
// yields and returns are treated as initializations rather than assignments.]
//
//
// This pass is applied to each function in turn.  The algorithm has four main
// steps:
// 1. Gather local (argument and variable) symbols and populate the alias map.
// 2. Perform flow analysis to create a flow graph in which each producer (of
//    ownership) has a consumer and vice versa.
// 3. Insert autocopy and autodestroy calls as needed to satisfy the
//    assumptions used in constructing the flow graph.
// See detailed comments attached to the routines containing those main steps.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// Dataflow analysis is used to propagate this constraint backwards, in case
// ownership is transferred out of a block along one path but not another.
// The sets used for flow analysis are:
//  live -- This set is created and updated locally to a given block.  It is
//          used to track the current liveness state within a block and does
//          not participate in global flow analysis.  It is really only needed
//          for the step that inserts autoCopy calls; but since the flag update
//          routines are shared between initial population of the PROD and CONS
//          sets and the later traversal to add autoCopy calls, we maintain the
//          live set in both.
//  PROD  -- The set of symbols whose ownership transitions to true anywhere in
//          the block.
//  CONS -- The set of symbols whose ownership transitions to false anywhere in
//          the block.
//  USE  -- The set of symbols used (read) within the given block.
//  EXIT -- The set of symbols whose end-of-scope coincides with the end of
//          this block.
//  IN   -- The set of symbols that are owned at the beginning of the block
//          (after forward flow analysis).
//  OUT  -- The set of symbols that are owned at the end of the block (after
//          forward flow analysis); the complement of the set of symbols that
//          must not be owned at the end of the block (after backward flow).
//
// After global flow analysis, live is initialized to IN[i].  AST elements that
// create ownership cause the corresponding bit(s) to transition to true and
// AST elements that consume ownership cause it to transition to false.  At the
// end of any block i, the invariant live == IN[i] + PROD[i] - CONS[i] should hold.
//
// PROD[i] contains a true bit corresponding to each symbol that is constructed
// in that block.  We expect that symbol is constructed only once, so if IN[i]
// and PROD[i] have a true bit in the same position, we can flag an internal
// error.  This condition is unlikely, so at best it should be added as a
// verify check.  
//
// CONS[i] contains a true bit corresponding to each symbol whose ownership is
// consumed in that block.  
//
// aliases -- We keep a separate list of aliases.  When any member of that set
// of aliases is consumed, all members of the set are added to CONS[i].
//
// We start by performing forward flow analysis to establish the value of IN.
// Within each block, 
//  OUT[i] <- IN[i] + PROD[i] - CONS[i]. (1)
// IN[i] is the intersection of OUT[pred(i)] for all predecessors of block i.
//
// For a block that contains a constructor followed by a destructor for the
// same symbol j, PROD[i,j] will be true and CONS[i,j] will be true.  In the
// within-block forward flow equation (1), we assume that if a prod and cons of
// the same symbol appear in the same block, the prod precedes the cons.  That
// implies a general assumption that the value of a symbol cannot be used
// before it has been defined, and that symbols are not reused (SA form).
// For a block that contains a destructor followed by a constructor for the
// same symbol j, PROD[i,j] and CONS[i,j] will both be true (and live at the
// beginning and end of the block will be false).
//
// We perform backward flow to establosh the value of OUT.  With in each block,
//  IN[i] <- OUT[i] + CONS[i] - PROD[i]. (2)
// We compute OUT[i] as the intersection of IN[succ(i)] for all successors of
// block i.
//
// After forward flow analysis, we traverse blocks again and add autoCopy calls
// where a symexpr is unowned (at that point in the flow) but being passed to
// an argument that consumes it.  (Consumers expect the corresonding operand to
// be owned; the autoCopy call adds the required ownership.)  Note that adding
// an autoCopy to an operand does not change OUT set for that block even though
// it adds a bit to the PROD set, because an autoCopy always corresponds to an
// AST element that behaves as a consume.  Therefore, we don't have to update OUT
// sets before performing the backward flow.
//
// For backward flow, the OUT set of any terminal block is set to all zeroes,
// and this is propagated back through the flow graph using equation (2)
// above.  Then we use the forward flow equation (1) to compute the live set at
// the end of the same block.  Subtracting OUT from this gives the set of
// symbols that have to be consumeed before the end of that block, i.e.:
//  to_cons = IN[i] + PROD[i] - CONS[i] - OUT[i]. (3)
// A destructor call is added for each of this symbols in the reverse of their
// declaration order.  Each added destructor call effectively sets the
// corresponding CONS[i,j] and clears the corresponding PROD[i,j].
