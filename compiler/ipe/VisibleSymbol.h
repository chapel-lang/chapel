* Function resolution requires a scan through a chain of DefScopes to find  *
* all visible functions with a given name followed by a complex algorithm   *
* that attempts to select a preferred function based on matching the list   *
* of formals to the list of actuals.                                        *
*                                                                           *
* This data structure is used to record an instance of a match. The         *
* resolution algorithm is depdendent on the distance, in terms of lexical   *
* scope, between the caller and the definition and so we need both the      *
* value and the scope in which the value was found.                         *
*                                                                           *
