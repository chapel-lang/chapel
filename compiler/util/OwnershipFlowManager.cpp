// Another implementation.
// A statement can have multiple exits, by jumping to a label that is outside
// the block.  The above algorithm assumes that there is only one exit block
// per construct, but there are counterexamples such as tryGetPath().

// Basic block analysis has already computed the successor blocks of each BB.
// To find out whether a given scope is being exited, we can compute the scope
// membership of the first statement in all of its successor blocks.  These
// should all agree as to whether a given scope is being exited.  However, an
// exception I can imagine is a do-while loop -- in which the branch
// transfers control back to the top of the loop while sequential execution
// falls through to the statment following the do-while construct.  In that
// case, an inserted autodestroy should follow the end of the statement.  We
// may need to add another slot to the do-while construct, so we have a place
// to put autodestroys that belong there.

// To compute EXIT(i,j), in each basic block we extract the first statement in
// the block.  For each symbol in our list, we test if that statement lies
// within its declaration scope.  If so, we set the corresponding bit in IN to
// true.  (We use IN as a temporary set for this calculation.)
// When that is done, we have a map showing basic blocks where each symbol is
// in scope.
// We then compute the difference, so EXIT records transitions from
// in-scope to not-in-scope.

// Conversion of an iterator into an "advance" function does unnatural

// that yield.  On the second and subsequent calls (until the loop exits),
// that initialization is bypassed, and we only execute one iteration of
// the body of the loop (from wherever the yield is and back to it).
// 1. Should a temporary variable go out of scope in the body of the loop,
//    it will be deleted once per iteration without ever being initialized.
// 2. Should a temporary variable go out of scope in a scope that contains the
//    loop (possibly just the loop itself), then the first incarnation of the
//    temporary will be leaked, and upon loop exit we will free an incarnation
//    of the temp that has never been initialized.
// We can argue that 1. can never happen because part of the conversion of
// the iterator function into "advance" involves scraping the function for
// all locals that can cross a yield, and placing these into the iterator
// state class (IC).  By the time we see the "advance" function, there are
// no locals that could survive past a yield.
// We can apply similar reasoning to conclude that a local in a loop body
// whose value is established before the yield must be used before the
// yield, and likewise one established after the yield must be used after
// the yield and before the end of the loop.  
// No temporary can be established after the yield and remain valid after
// returning to the top of the loop.  If this were true, then on the first
// iteration, its value would have to magically jump into existence before
// the body of the loop is first entered.
// Finally, any temporary whose value is established before entry to the loop
// portion of the construct must also be used before that entry.  Otherwise, we
// have the preceding problem in reverse: the variable must jump into existence
// after we resume from a yield in the loop body.
//
// What this means is that temporaries that have not been captured in the
// IC are "very local".  For a first cut, I think we can insert an autoDestroy
// just after the last use of a given symbol (as opposed to waiting for it to
// go out of scope.

//# NOTES
//#
//# Note #1: No reference tracking
//#  We do not track references in this version, which can lead to
//# assumptions about aliases being wrong in certain cases.  We get to treat
//# bitwise copies of an object as if they are aliases because they are
//# effectively the same object -- just residing at different locations in
//# memory.  However, if one of these is modified, then they are no longer
//# equivalent.  They should be the same object, but one of them is obsolete.
//# Which one?
//#  In this implementation, temporaries are initialized only once, and typically
//# used only once as well.  Named variables are also initialized only once, but
//# may be used in multiple places -- including as lvalues.
//#  Currently, we use a heuristic to determine the "current" alias -- we simply
//# use the last one in the alias chain.  This is likely to be the named
//# variable into which the call temps are finally assigned.
//#  The heuristic can be made more robust in two ways: 
//#  1. In alias sets that contain a named variable, ensure that this named
//# variable is unique (i.e. that the remaining aliases are unnamed
//# temporaries).  Then, actually use that named variable.
//#  2. Ensure that temporaries cannot be updated.  That is, that they are in
//# fact assigned only one, and that only constant references (i.e. specifically
//# not modifiable references) to them are created.
//#
//# Note #2: The return-value variable is special
//#  To avoid ambiguity in the ownership state of a variable on entry to a join
//# node, the ownership state of that symbol at the end of all predecessor
//# nodes must match.  Logical arguments can be used to conclude that only the
//# return-value variable (RVV) can be initialized along multiple paths through
//# the flow graph, so we can treat it as a special case.
//#  We also know that the RVV must be owned on entry to the final block in the
//# function.  After normalization, functions returning a value will contain a
//# return label that marks the beginning of that final block.
//#  To force the desired behavior, we treat the RVV as if it is a global
//# variable.  That means that a bitwise copy to it is treated as a
//# consumption.  The RVV itself is not tracked as a local variable, meaning
//# that it cannot participate in any alias cliques, and we do not adjust its
//# ownership state in the return statement.
