 * TODO Is there a need to do the post dominators and strictly post dominators?
 *       - The algorithm to do so is the same as computing dominators but you

 *         block rather than the ins.

/*
 * This function exists so that dead or unreachable basic blocks do not screw
 * up the dominator computation. Currently in the basic block creation gotos
 * will create a basic block immediately following them, regardless as to
 * whether there is actually any code or not.  
 *
 * For the example:
 * if cond then {
 *   // stuff
 *   goto _lbl;
 *   // unreachable stuff
 * }
 * // more stuff
 * _lbl:
 *
 * we would get something like
 *
 * 0: > 1 3
 *  cond
 * 1: 0 > 4
 *  // stuff
 *  goto _lbl;
 * 2: > 3
 *  // unreachable stuff
 * 3: 0 2 > 4
 *  // more stuff
 * 4: 1 3 >
 *  _lbl:
 * 
 * In this case an extra basic block is created and if there is nothing where 
 * unreachable stuff is, then we are creating a dead empty basic block. If we
 * have two goto's that goto the same label we get two empty basic blocks that
 * have no ins and a third empty basic block that is also empty but has the two
 * other empty basic blocks as ins. For this reason we can't just say ignore
 * all basic blocks with no ins because there can be more complex cases of dead
 * blocks that have ins (from other dead basic blocks.) The dominator analysis
 * assumed that there are no dead blocks as it leads to case where dead blocks
 * dominate every other blocks, which is clearly the  opposite of the truth.
 * 
 * This was an issue for LICM, where things that were not actually loops
 * were being identified as loops. Right now these dead empty basic blocks are
 * created even if there is no actual dead code in the AST. This is a result of
 * how basic blocks are currently created. It may be changed sometime after the
 * 1.8 release, in which case this function may become unnecessary. It can be
 * removed if we can guarantee that there are no dead blocks, and that the
 * basic block creation doesn't create any artificial dead blocks.
