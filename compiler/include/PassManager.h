// A PassT is a Pass that runs on things of type T and can return results of ResultType
//
// The default run behavior provides a common pattern that many passes
// exhibit, along with providing a place for an idempotence check to
// be used in the future. A PassT processes a single item of type T so
// that the caller can drive the execution.
//
// There might be a useful base class for this that has more general `run` method
// for instance, but for now having it templated over its input type is too useful.
//
// Run could equally be spelled operator() but I find the name more clear.
// I expect most of our uses today to be de-virtualized (thinking of perf).
//
// Some passes accumulate some result after the whole pass is done,
// which can be returned with getResult. This might be storing some
// info in a map for instance. Future work could extend a pass to be
// combinable (operator+ maybe) so that parallel execution could
// divide, conquer, and combine the results.
//

// A PassTU is a PassT that is concerned with processing things of type T and U
//
// A common example of this two type pass is FnSymbol and CallExpr and the
// following documentation uses it as a running example.
//
// There are two overloads of the `process` method that should be overridden:
//      general             | example
//   1) process(T x)        | process(FnSymbol* fn)
//   2) process(T x, U, y)  | process(FnSymbol* fn, CallExpr* call)
//
// The first overload serves to process the "primary" unit of work and can
// modify itself, but if/when it discovers more work to be done, it should use
// the appropriate overload of `enqueue`:
//      general             | example
//   1) enqueue(T x)        | enqueue(FnSymbol* fn)
//   2) enqueue(T x, U, y)  | enqueue(FnSymbol* fn, CallExpr* call)
//
// Each `enqueue` overload corresponds to a `process` overload and is in effect
// a delayed function call.
//
// The second overload is called to process a `call` in its enclosing `fn`
//

// PassManager runs passes over some collection of objects
//
// Today, we only have "immediate mode" execution of a pass or group
// of passes that operate on the same type. (as opposed to building up
// something like an execution graph that is later executed) because
// it still gives us the benefit of having the passmanager drive
// execution (so that sequential passes that operate over the same
// type can be chained (where possible)), but without the
// complexity. Part of the implementation difficulty with that
// approach today is that we have passes that operate on a load of
// different types and building up a typesafe graph of those is more
// trouble than worth at this point. One can imagine this would change
// when we have fewer pass types, like say Global, Module, Type, and
// Function. Its not clear to me at this point we can flip the switch
// today so that eg. a pass over CallExpr is actually a Function pass
// with an adapter to visit every CallExpr without a performance hit.
//

// only iterate over elements present when the pass started running, by
// noting the size at that time.
