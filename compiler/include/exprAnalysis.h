/*
 * This class contains necessary data structures and member functions
 * for expression analysis. At this point it is only used in
 * denormalize pass and functionality is rather simple.
 *
 * Its main use in the pass is to decide if expressions are movable
 * during denormalization. 
 *
 * For now, this is a very conservative analysis. A more precise
 * analysis could distinguish between reads and writes to memory and
 * to take into account alias analysis.
 *
 * Overall an expression is "unsafe" if:
 *
 * - It is an unsafe primitive(check implementation for a list)
 * - It is a function CallExpr where FnSymbol:
 *   - Has ref arguments(const ref should be fine but not implemented)
 *   - Touches any globals
 *   - Touches any externs
 *   - Has unsafe primitives
 *
 * Function safety check is recursive
