/* The different codegen methods return a GenRet.
   This class exists so that they can return partial expressions and support
   both C and LLVM intermediate results.

   When codegen-ing, we will either be producing C or LLVM output.

   GenRet structure includes a field - isLVPtr - which indicates whether or not
   the value is actually a pointer to the value we would normally be talking
   about
     - if it is GEN_VAL it can only be read (e.g. an integer constant);
     - if it is GEN_PTR it is a local pointer (e.g. to stack variable or array
       member);i
     - if it is GEN_WIDE, it is a wide pointer.
   For example, if we have
     var x:int;
     x = x + 5;

   in 'x = x + 5' the LHS would be a GenRet storing '&x' with isLVPtr=GEN_PTR.
   The 5 would be a GenRet storing '5' with isLVPtr=GEN_VAL, and the x on the
   RHS would be just like the other x: '&x' with isLVPtr=GEN_PTR. Then, when
   we code generate +, we will codegenValue both its arguments (since it is
   reading them), which will dereference '&x' to form 'x' with isLVPtr=GEN_VAL,
   and leave '5' alone since it is already a value.

   The approach is similar for wide pointers - isLVPtr=GEN_WIDE means that we
   have a wide pointer, and if we codegenValue it we will code generate a get;
   if we codegenAssign it to something we will generate a put.

   Note that as far as the code generator is concerned, Chapel references,
   classes, and _ddata arrays are all mutable pointers to something; that is if
   we had a variable of that type, we would normally create a
   pointer-to-the-pointer and set isLVPtr=GEN_PTR - so that what is being
   pointed to can be changed. Put another way, references and class types are
   'value types' as far as the code generator is concerned.

   In particular note that a variable of reference type can be changed to point
   to something else. Sometimes the code generator is required to do that, even
   though it does not normally make sense with the Chapel reference semantics.

   Lastly, note that GenRet is implicitly convertible from
   BaseAST* (code generate some Chapel thing)
   const char* (generate a string)
   int (generate an int)
