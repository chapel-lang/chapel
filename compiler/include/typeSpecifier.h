//
// It is defined to return NULL for more general type specifiers.
//
// This function was initially defined for a simple use in preFold().
// In that use case it generated FATAL errors for invalid primitives.
//
// It was exposed to allow it to be used in earlier passes
// e.g. in limited situations within normalize.  In these
// situations param-folding will not have occurred and it
// is necessary to suppress any error messages and simply
// return NULL.
