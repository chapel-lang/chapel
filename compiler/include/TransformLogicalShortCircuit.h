*                                                                           *
* This transformer is responsible for converting any uses of binary logical *
* AND or binary logical OR into an equivalent form using IF statements that *
* implements the required short-circuit semantics.                          *
*                                                                           *
* These binary operators cannot be expressed using Chapel primitives as     *
* these evaluate both arguments before invoking the operator.  Hence this   *
* transformation must be applied before function resolution.  In the        *
* current implementation this Visitor is leveraged early in normalize().    *
*                                                                           *
* This transform inserts Chapel if-expressions that must be in the same     *
* scope as the boolean operators.  Hence the transformer requires that a    *
* suitable insertion point be provided to the constructor.                  *
*                                                                           *
