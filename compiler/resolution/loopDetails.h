leaderDetails is only relevant for leader/follower iterators

followerForLoop is the follower ForLoop in leader/follower iteration.

When considering zippered iteration, detailsVector contains details of
the individually zippered iterations.

When considering non-zippered iteration, detailsVector contains exactly
one element. It stores information
about the loop. In leader/follower loops, it contains information about
the follower loop.

Always uses the non-fast-follower version of the follower loop.
