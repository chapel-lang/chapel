Cray Testing
============

The Chapel team at Cray, Inc. manages a suite of correctness and performance
tests on a variety of platforms and environments.

TODO: list the cray tests here... (thomasvandoren, 2014-07-01)

Discontinued testing (that we might like to revive)
===================================================
- opts   (start_opt_test, nightly-opts-all.cron, nightly-opts-examples.cron)

Discontinued testing (that we don't care about anymore)
=======================================================
- mpi    (was: nightly.chap04     up to r19116)
- XMT (was nightly.chap07, preserved as nightly.xmt)

Other notes
===========

start_opt_test
--------------

Currently unused - in part because there were always holes and there
wasn't a good diffing system as with the normal nightly runs. So
sifting through logs to see what was changing required a lot of
human effort. We keep it around in hopes of resurrecting it.



Testing changes to these scripts
--------------------------------

export CHPL_NIGHTLY_LOGDIR=$PWD/chapel-test-logs
export CHPL_NIGHTLY_CRON_LOGDIR=$PWD/chapel-test-logs
export CHPL_NIGHTLY_CRON_RECIPIENT=$USER@cray.com
export CHPL_NIGHTLY_TEST_CONFIG_NAME=$USER.test

# Run the script, if appropriate
./util/cron/test-linux32.bash

# or run nightly directly
./util/cron/nightly -cron -hellos
