# Do a perf run with "-ffast-math" thrown to the backend compiler. Meant to
# help figure out the defaults for --[no-]ieee-float and the performance
# implications (https://github.com/chapel-lang/chapel/pull/1593)
#
# TODO depending on the results of this try throwing more specific floating
# point optimizations flags instead of ffast-math, which is a big hammer and
# possibly check the perf impact with newer hardware/compilers (add an xc
# single locale performance run.)
#
# Graph the default config and this config side by side to make comparison
# easy, but sync to a different direction so the default chap04 graphs don't
# have multiple configurations.
