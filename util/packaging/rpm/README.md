# Chapel RPM Packages

This directory contains the scripts necessary to build Chapel rpm packages.

## Directory Structure

Each OS should have its own directory containing the scripts necessary to build
the Chapel rpm packages for that OS. Each one should have a Dockerfile that can
be used to build the package in a clean environment.

The `common` directory contains the common scripts and configuration files used
by all the packages. The docker builds use the `rpm` directory as the context
and pulls in these files as needed.

The fedorarawhide directory is used to build rpms for the development Fedora
release using [packit](https://packit.dev).
