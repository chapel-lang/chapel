==================================
Chapel Developer Utility Directory
==================================

This directory contains utility scripts that are useful mostly to developers.
For example:

  chpl-run         : compiles a Chapel program and runs it right away
  receive_patch    : two scripts useful for moving patches between trees
  send_patch
  test/
    cat_futures    : prints all the futures to the console with name/lineno
                     (Sung says could be written much more efficiently)
    compileTest    : compiles a single test using appropriate COMPOPTS/.compopts
    extract_tests  : used to extract tests from the language spec sources
    list_futures   : lists all the futures by printing the first line in .future
    setTestIgnores : sets standard files to svn:ignore in a test directory
                     (note: overrides existing svn:ignores, so use with caution)
