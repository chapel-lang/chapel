To determine lines in the compiler that are never executed when the
tests are run:

1. cd compiler
2. setenv CHPL_GCOV 1
3. make clean
4. make
5. perl Coverage.pl

This will print out filenames that have unexecuted code.  It is
formatted to show the function followed by the lines that are not
executed.  The line numbers correspond to the lines in the C++.
