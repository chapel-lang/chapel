# TODO: Migrate this configuration over to Apptainer. Michael ran into initial
# difficulties with this because:
# - Homebrew wants to install itself in system directories (/opt/homebrew on
#   ARM macs), and Apptainer wants those to be bind mounted from the host,
#   but we don't want to allow the Apptainer run to modify host system dirs. We
#   would need to enumerate and set up the necessary dirs as within the
#   container only.
# - Homebrew is meant to be run as non-root, which would require more work in
#   the image build (and perhaps container run) to accommodate.
