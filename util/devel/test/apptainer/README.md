# Getting started with apptainer

See http://apptainer.org/docs/user/latest/

# Where to find images

* You can find docker containers on https://hub.docker.com

# Notes on writing .def files

## Example using a docker image
BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:16.04

## Example using a docker image from quay.io
BootStrap: docker
From: quay.io/centos/centos:stream9

## Notes about command sections
%post commands run as root
%runscript commands run as regular user

# Commands to run

## to construct the image
apptainer build --fakeroot image.sif image.def

#To create an image for experimenting with where you can install
# more packages etc, use this:
#   sudo apptainer build --sandbox image.sif image.def
#
#   # to explore as root
#   sudo apptainer shell --writable image.sif
#
#   # to explore not as root
#   apptainer shell --writable image.sif


## to run the runscript
apptainer run image.sif

## to run a shell within the image
apptainer shell image.sif

By default, environment is included in run commands.
Also the directory stays the same (so e.g. a chapel directory
will appear next to image.sif if it is created from
within the image)
