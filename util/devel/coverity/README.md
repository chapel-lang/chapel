Coverity Scan for Chapel
========================

The Chapel Coverity Scan project is here:

https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1222

Model File
----------

The model file used by the project is in this directory,
[`coverity_model.cpp`](coverity_model.cpp). For more information on modeling,
refer to the Coverity documentation:

https://scan.coverity.com/tune

Remember that changes to the model file must be committed to the repository
(for auditing purposes) **and** uploaded to the project page.

Running the Scan
----------------

The Chapel team has configured a job to automatically run the Coverity Scan
periodically. You should not need to run this manually.

The [`submit_build.bash`](submit_build.bash) script in this directory is used
to run the scan. Once everything is configured (see below), clone a clean copy
of the repo and run the script.

Scan Configuration
-------------------

* Download and unpack the analysis tools (currently Chapel team is using
  linux64 to run the scan):https://scan.coverity.com/download?tab=cxx
* Create a `~/.coverity` file with the following:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

COV_SCAN_EMAIL=<coverity user email>
COV_SCAN_TOKEN=<coverity scan token>
COV_BUILD_PREFIX=<coverity analysis tools location>
```

For example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

COV_SCAN_EMAIL=thomas@example.com
COV_SCAN_TOKEN=my-coverity-token
COV_BUILD_PREFIX=/opt/cov-analysis/cov-analysis-linux64-7.5.0/bin
```

The token can be found on
[New Build page](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/1222/builds/new).
