#
# Use this script to generate performance for the current suite of
# tests across the past several releases (those that are outlined
# below).
#
# To use it:
#
# * note that this script is currently hard-coded to our usage of if
#   at Cray in terms of referring to certain paths and pre-installed
#   locations of past releases.
#
# * set CHPL_HOME to indicate the current CHPL_HOME that you want to
#   use (from which the util/ scripts will be used).  Note that this
#   copy of the repository should be in /tmp or on the local disk (if
#   you want to make the results comparable to the ones we gather
#   nightly) and up-to-date with the master.
#
# * optionally, set CHPL_TEST_PERF_DIR to indicate where you want
#   the output .dat and html/ files to be placed.  By default, it
#   will use $CHPL_HOME/test/perfdat-releases/
#
# * cd to the test/ directory (or subdirectory) that you want to test
#   (typically $CHPL_HOME/test) and run testReleasesPerformance.  As
#   in a normal test run, this will test all subdirectories under the
#   cwd.
#
# * the script will then run the current performance tests across all
#   past releases.
