# This script is a system-wide prediff for use with the OpenMPI mpirun
# launcher.  Depending on how OpenMPI is configured, when mpirun sees
# a program it launched exit with a non-zero status, it may print one
# or more messages describing what happened.  While these are helpful
# for a human observer, they're a problem for the testing system's
# output comparisons.  This script removes them.

import sys, re

# These match the message blocks we want to remove.
