        user, per machine.

        filelock is a platform independent lock that uses 1 of 3 platform
        dependent implementations. It will use `fcntl.flock` on unix systems
        (including mac and cygwin) to create a hard lock, `msvcrt.locking` on
        windows systems, and a soft file-based lock otherwise. fcntl and msvcrt
        don't have issues with 'stale' locks because the lock is held on the
        file descriptor and gets dropped by the OS even if the program crashes.
        The soft file-based lock can cause stale locks, so if we ever run into
        a platform where fcntl/msvcrt aren't supported we should re-add our own
        implementation that can deal with stale lock files.

        Also note that fcntl/msvcrt will leave the actual file used for locking
        around. Removing the file would "unlock" the lock, so there'd be a race
        between unlocking/removing and locking (we'd effectively have a double
        unlock). This is a common problem for file-based locks including
        "fasteners" (https://github.com/harlowja/fasteners/issues/26) """
