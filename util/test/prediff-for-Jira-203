# This script is for the use with 'start_test' as the system-wide prediff, to
# suppress sporadic false test errors observed on both kaibab and kay-elogin,
# caused by "Transient MPP reservation error on create" appearing in the test
# output.

# This is thought to be a system issue, caused by a miscommunication between
# ALPS and PBS. Not a Chapel issue.

# See Jira #203 (https://chapel.atlassian.net/browse/CHAPEL-203) for more info.

# To use this prediff file with start_test (assuming bash):
#
# export CHPL_SYSTEM_PREEXEC=$CHPL_HOME/util/test/prediff-for-Jira-203
# start_test ...
