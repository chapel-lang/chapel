# This script is for the use with 'start_test' as the system-wide prediff, to
# suppress sporadic false test errors observed on both kaibab and kay-elogin,
# caused by "Transient MPP reservation error on create" appearing in the test
# output.

# This is thought to be a system issue, caused by a miscommunication between
# ALPS and PBS. Not a Chapel issue.

# Note: start_test's error handler also recognizes the same string,
#   "Transient MPP reservation error on create",
# and, if found, generates a more-recognizable error msg,
#   "Error: Jira 203 -- Transient MPP reservation error",
# instead of the generic
#   "Error matching program output".

# See Jira #203 (https://chapel.atlassian.net/browse/CHAPEL-203) for more info.

# To use this prediff file with start_test (assuming bash):
#
# export CHPL_SYSTEM_PREEXEC=$CHPL_HOME/util/test/prediff-for-Jira-203
# start_test ...
