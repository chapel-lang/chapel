Chapel Configuration Utility Directory
======================================

This directory contains utility scripts used to configure the Chapel
build.  The contents are as follows:

   compileline : a utility that helps to determine the C compiler line
                 used to build generated code

   make_sys_basic_types.py : a script that determines the size of various C
                             types (e.g., long, size_t, etc.) and creates a
                             Chapel module creating 'extern type'
                             declarations so that Chapel code can refer to
                             the types.
