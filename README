IEEEtran.cls version 1.8 revises format specifications so that the final
layout more closely matches the layout of the Microsoft Word templates.

Additionally, the IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf now includes the notice to not use
symbols, special characters, or math in the paper title and abstract.

IEEEtran is the official LaTeX class for authors of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) transactions journals and
conferences. The latest version of the IEEEtran package can be found
at CTAN:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/

as well as within IEEE's site:

http://www.ieee.org/

Version 1.7a is a bug fix release that corrects the two column peer
review title page problem. This problem was not present in the 1.6 series.


V1.7 is a significant update over the 1.6 series with many important
changes. For a full list, please read the file changelog.txt. The most
notable changes include:

 1. New class option compsoc to support the IEEE Computer Society format.

 2. Several commands and environments have been deprecated in favor of
    replacements with IEEE prefixes to better avoid potential future name
    clashes with other packages. Legacy code retained to allow the use of
    the obsolete forms (for now), but with a warning message to the console
    during compilation:
    \IEEEauthorblockA, \IEEEauthorblockN, \IEEEauthorrefmark,
    \IEEEbiography, \IEEEbiographynophoto, \IEEEkeywords, \IEEEPARstart,
    \IEEEproof, \IEEEpubid, \IEEEpubidadjcol, \IEEEQED, \IEEEQEDclosed,
    \IEEEQEDopen, \IEEEspecialpapernotice. IEEEtran.cls now redefines
    \proof in way to avoid problems with the amsthm.sty package.
    For IED lists:
    \IEEEiedlabeljustifyc, \IEEEiedlabeljustifyl, \IEEEiedlabeljustifyr,
    \IEEEnocalcleftmargin, \IEEElabelindent, \IEEEsetlabelwidth,
    \IEEEusemathlabelsep
    These commands/lengths now require the IEEE prefix and do not have
    legacy support: \IEEEnormaljot.
    For IED lists: \ifIEEEnocalcleftmargin, \ifIEEEnolabelindentfactor,
    \IEEEiedlistdecl, \IEEElabelindentfactor

 3. New \CLASSINPUT, \CLASSOPTION and \CLASSINFO interface allows for more
    user control and conditional compilation.

 4. Several bug fixes and improved compatibility with other packages.


A note to those who create classes derived from IEEEtran.cls: Consider the
use of patch code, either in an example .tex file or as a .sty file,
rather than creating a new class. The IEEEtran.cls CLASSINPUT interface
allows IEEEtran.cls to be fully programmable with respect to document
margins, so there is no need for new class files just for altered margins.
In this way, authors can benefit from updates to IEEEtran.cls and the need
to maintain derivative classes and backport later IEEEtran.cls revisions
thereto is avoided. As always, developers who create classes derived from
IEEEtran.cls should use a different name for the derived class, so that it
cannot be confused with the official/base version here, as well as provide
authors with technical support for the derived class. It is generally a bad
idea to produce a new class that is not going to be maintained.


Best wishes for all your publication endeavors,
