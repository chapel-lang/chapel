# tends to improve the compiler performance.

# Another option for cce is the -hdevelop feature, which attempts to improve
# compilation time by throttling certain things in the compiler that are known
# to add time. For Chapel codes, -O0 tends to give the fastest compile times,
# which is why it is used here. -hdevelop is something to look at in the future
# if execution time becomes too slow with -O0.
