#
# Tools
#
# You must substitute the g++/gcc compilers with TAU scripts tau_cc.sh and tau_cxx.sh
# These scripts can read the TAU configurations using TAU_MAKEFILE and the 
# compiler parameters such as compiler-based instrumentation from TAU_OPTIONS
# setenv TAU_MAKEFILE /usr/local/packages/tau/x86_64/lib/Makefile.tau-papi-pthread-pdt
# setenv TAU_OPTIONS '-optCompInst -optQuiet'  
CC = tau_cc.sh 
CXX = tau_cxx.sh 
# for instance or hardcode these names as:
#CXX = tau_cc.sh -tau_options='-optCompInst -optVerbose' -tau_makefile=/usr/local/packages/tau/i386_linux/lib/Makefile.tau-papi-pthread-pdt
#CC = tau_cc.sh -tau_options='-optCompInst -optVerbose' -tau_makefile=/usr/local/packages/tau/i386_linux/lib/Makefile.tau-papi-pthread-pdt
#CXX = g++
#CC = gcc
