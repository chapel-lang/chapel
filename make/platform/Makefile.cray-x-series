# Statically link in libstdc++ so that it doesn't matter what compiler a user
# has loaded at `chpl` invocation time. We build the compiler (and llvm) with a
# specific version of gcc, but we don't want to force users to have that gcc
# version loaded. Ideally we would just set an rpath to /opt/cray/gcc-libs and
# /opt/cray/pe/gcc-libs, but this only works for non PrgEnv-gnu compilers.
# PrgEnv-gnu sets a LD_LIBRARY_PATH to include a set of libs that could be
# older than the versions we build the compiler and llvm with.
