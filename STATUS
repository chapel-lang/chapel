============================
Chapel Implementation Status
============================

This file contains a list of unimplemented features and known bugs in
the Chapel implementation.  If you find additional bugs and
unimplemented features, or if you would like to request prioritization
of items in this file, please let us know at
chapel-bugs@lists.sourceforge.net or chapel_info@cray.com.  Please
feel encouraged to err on the side of mailing us with any issues you
run into.


----------------------------------------------------------------
General (see also portability section at the bottom of this file)
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Some error messages continue to be confusing/unhelpful
  Workaround: Please ask us for help interpreting any that you struggle with
- Compiler and runtime errors don't always report useful line numbers
  Workaround: Please ask us for help finding the correct error location
- Names in a Chapel program can collide with names used internally
  Workaround: Avoid using chpl_ or chpl__ as prefixes to symbol names


--------------------------------
Variables, Types and Expressions
--------------------------------

Unimplemented Features:

Bugs:
- Constant arrays, domains, records, and tuples can be modified (without error)
- Array types cannot be specified in expressions, tuple types, or return types
- Indices over parameter for loops are changed to values of 'int' type
- Types and values can be compared (without error)
    e.g., "int == 2"
- Configuration parameters are not type-checked when on the command line


-------
Modules
-------

Unimplemented Features:

Bugs:
- There is an odd case where a function call can resolve to a function in a
  different module if a use of that module exists in an inner scope (without
  error)


---------
Functions
---------

Unimplemented Features:

Bugs:
- Programs requiring non-linear function resolution may not work, resulting 
  in an internal failure with code CAL0035
    e.g., mutual module uses that access variables across both modules
- Variable functions can return local data through an lvalue that is not a
  simple identifier


----------------------------
Classes, Records, and Unions
----------------------------

Unimplemented Features:
- Multiple inheritance is not supported
- Type select on unions is not implemented

Bugs:
- Constant fields can be modified (without error)
- User-defined constructors are not robust
- Constructors with side effects may be invoked when their type is declared
- The default output function for empty records and classes may display a
  place-holder field which is an artifact of our implementation


-----------------------------
Tuples, Ranges, and Iterators
-----------------------------

Unimplemented Features:

Bugs:
- Nested var iterators may not work correctly
- The implicit 'setter' argument does not work in var iterators
- Iterators in records cannot change fields in that record


---------------------------
Ranges, Arrays, and Domains
---------------------------

Unimplemented Features:
- Array promotion/forall/for/scan expressions always evaluate to 1D arrays
    e.g., foo(A) where A promotes foo() should result in an array of type:
          [A.domain] foo(A(i)).type but instead results in a 1D array
    e.g., [i in D] foo(i) should result in an array of type: [D] foo(i).type
          but instead results in a 1D array
- Arrays of arrays where the inner arrays vary in size are not supported
- Sparse domain/array assignment, slicing, and index removal is not supported
- There are no bounds checks on index types
- There are no subset checks on subdomains

Bugs:
- Constant domains can be modified if passed to functions
- Records with array members of recursive types do not work
- Arrays and domains of different ranks can be zippered serially
- Domains/arrays of different index types cannot be zippered in parallel
- Array and domain runtime information is not preserved through generic types
- Array aliases cannot be declared as fields without an element type
- Range operations can result in overflow
    e.g., (0:uint..5 by -1).length
- Arrays declared over domains with negative strides may not work
- Parallel iterations over domains/arrays may be problematic as
  problem sizes approach number of cores

--------
Generics
--------

Unimplemented Features:

Bugs:
- Subclassing uninstantiated generic classes should be prohibited but is not
- Compiler errors via the compilerError function may be issued too eagerly in
  the presence of dynamic dispatch
- Generic type names can sometimes contain extra parentheses especially in the
  presence of parameters with default values
- Records cannot be generic over real parameters
- Type and parameter functions are not checked for side effects


-------------------------------
Parallelism and Synchronization
-------------------------------

Unimplemented Features:
- Atomic statements are not implemented
- Whole array assignment is serialized

Bugs:
- Deadlocks are possible if the system has too few threads or maxThreads is set
  too low
- Array elements accessed via references in begin statements in which the array
  is not also accessed may outlive the existence of the array


--------------------
Reductions and Scans
--------------------

Unimplemented Features:
- User-defined reductions and scans are not yet implemented

Bugs:
- Reductions and scans do not work when their element type is itself an array
- Scans are serial


--------------------------
Locality and Distributions
--------------------------

Unimplemented Features:
- On statement variable declarations are not yet supported
    e.g., on Locales(1) var x: real;
- Support for multi-locale distributed domains and arrays is limited
- The Block distribution does not support array resizing
- The Cyclic and BlockCyclic distributions are not yet complete

Bugs:
- String assignment across locales is by reference rather than value
- The locale type has a default value of 'nil'


----------------
Input and Output
----------------

Unimplemented Features:
- Format control for the output precision/width of scalar values
  Workaround: see doc/technotes/README.format
- Input of whole arrays, e.g., read(A);
  Workaround: use a loop and read in the elements one at a time
    e.g., for i in A.domain do read(A(i));

Bugs:
- Specifying a writeThis method for user-defined output of records or classes
  with an on-statement can lead to a deadlock


-----------------
Standard Library
-----------------

Unimplemented Features:
- On some platforms, the Math module is limited by C support

Bugs:


-----------------
Memory Management
-----------------

Status:
- Strings are leaked
- Distributed privatized domains and arrays are leaked
- Data associated with iterators may be leaked
- Some data that the compiler moves to the heap are leaked


-----------
Portability
-----------

Cray XT:
- The memory limit for Chapel programs may need to be set manually --
  see doc/platforms/README.xt-cle for details

Cray CX1:
- We currently only support CX1s running Linux

IBM Power5/Power6 systems:
- we have had some initial successes executing Chapel on these machines --
  see doc/platforms/README.ibm for details

PGI compilers (and possibly others):
- Identifiers in the generated code may exceed the back-end compiler's limit
- Floating point literals of -0.0 may not work as intended
