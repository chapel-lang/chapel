The Chapel Language
===================

What is Chapel?
---------------
Chapel is a modern programming language designed for productive
parallel computing at scale. Chapel's design and implementation have
been undertaken with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on
multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in
addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was originally
undertaken.

License
-------
Chapel is developed and released under the terms of the Apache 2.0
license, though it also makes use of third-party packages under their
own licensing terms.  See the `LICENSE`_ file in this directory for
details.
