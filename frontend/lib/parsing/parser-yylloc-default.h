  Override how locations are computed during reductions.

  Note that the IF branch of this macro is the same as its GNU counterpart.
  It is the ELSE branch which is different. The original GNU definition is:

  ```
  (cur__).first_line \
      = (cur__).last_line \
      = YYRHSLOC(rhs__, 0).last_line; \
  (cur__).first_column \
      = (cur__).last_column \
      = YYRHSLOC(rhs__, 0).last_column; \
  ```

  The else branch defines what occurs for a zero component reduction (as
  far as I can tell this only occurs for null/empty rules). The previous
  behavior would set the location of the entire reduction to be the
  line/column of the last consumed input token. Since a null reduction
  consumes no input, it is possible for the last consumed token to be
  one used in a previous reduction.

  ```
  module Foo {    // Line 1
    var x: int;   // 2
  }               // 3
  module Bar {    // 4
  // ...
  ```

  The effect is for the productions in front of 'module Bar' (which are
  both null rules for the access specifier and 'prototype' keyword) to
  have the location (3:2), which is the location of the newline right
  before the reduction for the entire 'Bar' module rule occurs.

  If you look at how locations are computed in the IF branch, that means
  that the '@$' for the entire 'module Bar {' ends up being (3:2-...),
  which has an effect on how line numbers appear for _everything_. It's
  basically an off-by-one error for line numbers across the entire program
  (or at least, a program using any `opt_` productions with null rules).

  This problem didn't manifest itself much in the old AST world due to
  how...mutable...everything was. In the uAST land we have to carry
  components around until we're done reducing, and then finally build
  the uAST node. So line numbers are off quite often.

  What's been done to fix this is: for zero application reductions, set
  the location of the entire reduction to be the location of the current
  lookahead token. In essence, optimistically look 1 forward instead of
  1 back (assume that we will consume some non-zero amount of input in a
  future reduction).

  TODO (dlongnecke): I am not sure if it's valid to use the lookahead
  token value when in an error handling state, though the documentation
  does say that when collapsing erroneous reductions the IF branch
  should be taken. That is to say - what happens for error states
  needs to be tested. Might have to use 'yyclearin'.
