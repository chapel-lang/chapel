    'scope' is the context in which the name occurs (e.g. as an Identifier)

    'receiverScope' is the scope of a type containing the name, in the case
    of method calls, field accesses, and resolving a name within a method.
    It is a Scope representing the record/class/union itself for the
    receiver. If provided, the receiverScope will be consulted before
    'scope' and its parents.

    The config argument is a group of or-ed together bit flags
    that adjusts the behavior of the lookup:

    * If LOOKUP_DECLS is set, looks for symbols declared in 'scope'
      and 'receiverScope'.
    * If LOOKUP_IMPORT_AND_USE is set, looks for symbols from use/import
      statements in this 'scope' and 'receiverScope'.
    * If LOOKUP_PARENTS is set, looks for symbols from parent scopes (but not
      parent modules of a module) including looking for declarations and
      handling imports, and including finding declarations in the root module.
    * If LOOKUP_TOPLEVEL is set, checks for a toplevel module with this name.
    * If LOOKUP_INNERMOST is true, limits search to the innermost scope with a
      match.
