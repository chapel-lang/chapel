    Scope representing the record/class/union itself for the receiver. If
    provided, the receiverScopes will be consulted after declarations within
    'scope' but before its parents. It accepts multiple scopes in order to
    handle classes with inheritance.

    behavior of the lookup. Please see 'LookupConfig' and the related constants
    such as 'LOOKUP_DECLS' for further details.
