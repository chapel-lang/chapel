// We enumerate all the errors in Dyno as macros in this file. By doing so,
// and by re-defining the DIAGNOSTIC_CLASS macro (which ERROR_CLASS and
// WARNING_CLASS are shorthands for), we can generate code for every error
// type, multiple times. With judicious definitions of DIAGNOSTIC_CLASS, we
// can generate an enum of all error types, class declarations for every
// error, as well as implementation of query / caching functions.
//
// Calls to the ERROR_CLASS/WARNING_CLASS/etc. macros should list the new
// error's name first, followed a list of types describing error details.
//
// Errors are grouped by which compilation stage they relate to, and sorted
// alphabetically within these groups. Groups themselves are ordered by the
// order their compilation stages occur in.
